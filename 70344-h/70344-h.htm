THE SPARE BED</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> is the matter? What has happened?” asked
Aunt Lizzie. “Just open the window and find out,”
she added, with her usual brisk decision.</p>

<p>It was nine o’clock on a dull September evening,
and we two ladies were seated side by side in a 40 h.p.
Daimler, which had suddenly come to a full stop on a
country road, in the west of Ireland. On either hand
stretched a wide expanse of dark mysterious country,
to which the white waving bog cotton gave a ghostly,
weird appearance. Black water in neighbouring bog-holes
flashed back on us like phantom eyes, a dazzling
reflection of the motor’s huge lamps. Undoubtedly
our outlook was sombre and discouraging—as if the
land nurtured some secret sorrow that no stranger
could properly understand. The moon had not yet
risen, but was shyly peeping at us from behind a low
range of distant hills; not a soul was in sight, nor a
sound to be heard, except the cry of a belated curlew,
and the voices of our men; the car itself had ceased to
throb.</p>

<p>As the chauffeur came to the window, and touched
his cap, my aunt said:</p>

<p>“Have you missed the road, Watkin? Or is it a
breakdown?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>“I’m afraid it’s a bit of both, ma’am. You see,
these ’ere cross-country roads is terrible puzzling, and
I’m thinking we took the wrong turn about three mile
back. Then there’s been a kind of a mishap to the car—this
extra twenty miles and bad road has done it.
If we had stopped at Mulligooley for the night I was
going to overhaul her, and have her all right for the
morning.”</p>

<p>Watkin (an old servant) was obviously aggrieved;
he had no sympathy with his mistress’s continual
craving to push on, and would have preferred to spend
the night in a poky country hotel, sup and smoke
comfortably, and brag a little about his car.</p>

<p>“But surely we ought to be near the station by this
time. I’ll get out and have a look round.” As she
spoke, my aunt nimbly descended, and I followed.
For her fifty-five years, she was an extraordinarily
active and energetic person.</p>

<p>Gaze around as we might, there was no sign of
lights, or station, and, as far as one could judge by
appearances, we four people, standing by an empty
motor, were alone in a world of brooding solitude.</p>

<p>“Do you think, Watkin, we have <i>any</i> chance of
getting on?”</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am, I’m afraid not. You see, if it was
only a burst tyre—we might manage—but——” he
coughed behind his dogskin glove.</p>

<p>But he was too wise to say “I told you so.” This
foolish late trip had been made entirely against his
warning and advice; and behold us with night at
hand, stranded on a desolate bog road, apparently out
of humanity’s reach. My aunt, Miss Elizabeth
Barrett, and I, had been making a tour through Ireland,
and so far everything had gone smoothly; roads,
weather, motor, even the accommodation at inns was
better than we anticipated. We had visited Portrush,
the Giant’s Causeway, Dublin, Wicklow, Killarney,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Connemara, and were now on our way to Queenstown—and
England.</p>

<p>“I expect this is <i>the</i> adventure at last!” suggested
my aunt cheerfully; “it would be too bad to leave
Ireland without one.”</p>

<p>“If it is the adventure,” I answered, “it is not of
the description I care for. I——”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” she interrupted, “but you are
three and twenty—I know <i>your</i> kind!”</p>

<p>“So I suppose we shall spend the night sitting in
the road?” I grumbled.</p>

<p>“No, no, that is not to be thought of, with your
delicate chest. We shall get a bed somewhere. Ah!”
in a tone of triumph, “look over to the left, on the
rising ground—there is a light—two lights—it’s a
house!” Then, raising her voice, she said to the
footman, “Jopp! I see a cottage on that hill. Take
one of the car lamps, and go and ask if they can give
us a night’s lodging.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” said Jopp, and presently he set off
with, as it seemed to me, considerable reluctance, in
the direction of this beacon. Meanwhile we remained
in the motor—whilst Watkin grovelled beneath it—and
watched the lamp flickering over the bog, and
taking a surprisingly zig-zag course.</p>

<p>“I was sure there would be some house,” said my
companion complacently, “and I do hope the bed will
be clean! It will be rather fun for once, won’t it?”</p>

<p>Her character was optimistic, active, and restless.
She gave the impression of being determined to get all
she could out of what remained to her of life—since
her youth and middle age had been cruelly cramped
and sacrificed.</p>

<p>My aunt was slim and erect, with thin clear-cut
profile, keen blue eyes, beautiful white hair, and a very
strong will. And why not? A spinster lady, with no
encumbrance, no ailing relatives, and four thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
a year, can well afford one. Aunt Liz had not long
enjoyed such easy circumstances. Most of her life
had been absorbed in assiduous attendance on a hypochondriacal
old godfather; her spring and summer
had passed in housekeeping, nursing, reading aloud,
listening to continuous grumbling, scolding, and
symptoms and accompanying the invalid to endless
foreign cures. Such had been her existence. For
this servitude she received sixty pounds a year, and
washing; but when her tyrant died it was found that
he had not been ungrateful, and had left her an unexpectedly
large fortune, and, late as it was, she lost
no time in becoming a live woman! A cottage in the
country, a flat in town, and a motor, were soon among
her possessions, but for the greater part of the year
she lived in the car. Watkin, her late godfather’s
coachman, had learnt this new job; Jopp, the footman,
was his nephew, so we were quite a little family party!
My sister and I were orphans—she, however, had a
husband. Aunt Liz had always been more than good
to us; I was supposed to be her favourite of the two,
because I had her nose, was rather delicate, and not
the least afraid of her sharp tongue. For some time
I was a probationer in the Children’s Hospital in Great
Ormonde Street, but my health broke down, and I was
now companion to my aunt—and she was <i>my</i> nurse!</p>

<p>Although we did not admit the fact, I think there
is no doubt that we were both in the enjoyment of a
comfortable little nap, when we were disturbed by the
return of Jopp—looking extraordinarily hot and mud-stained.</p>

<p>“Well?” we asked in the same breath.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry, ma’am, but the people at the
house—it’s a full mile away—mostly talk Irish. I
made out that they have no beds—they want what
there are themselves; but if you wouldn’t mind settin’
up in the kitchen they make no objection.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>“No, I daresay not!” rejoined my relative, throwing
up her chin, “and one hears so much of Irish
hospitality! I intend to sleep there, and I shall go
over and interview her myself—I suppose it’s a
woman?” appealing to Jopp.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, quite a crowd of women—a houseful,
I should say. It’s a rough sort of place for ladies;
it looked like a kind of wedding party.”</p>

<p>“A party—that settles it! Millie” (to me) “we
will start at once—wrap up well. I am <i>afraid</i> we
shall have rather a disagreeable walk, but it will be
something to spend a night in a real Irish cottage.
Jopp will carry our dressing-bags, and Watkin the
lamp. No one will touch the car, and anyway, they
cannot carry it away, so we will all sleep out.”</p>

<p>Here I must draw a decent veil over our muddy
excursion, our climbing of gates, evading of bog-holes,
and wading through fields. At last we turned
into a deep lane; this led up to a yard, in which stood
an enormous manure-heap, several empty turf-carts,
and a long, slated house of one story. There were
lights in three windows, and my aunt hammered
vigorously on the door, which was immediately
opened by a tall woman with black hair and high
cheek-bones. She stood in a sort of little entrance,
from which one could see into a kitchen with a roaring
turf fire. It appeared to be full of people.</p>

<p>Aunt Liz, in her high, clear English accent, made
her request with civil confidence. A bed for her niece
and self, and permission for the men to sit up in the
kitchen; she promised to give no trouble, and would
pay well.</p>

<p>“I am terribly sorry, me lady, but I can’t take ye
in nohow,” declared the woman; “we are shockingly
put about—and the house is throng as it is.”</p>

<p>My aunt edged her way further and looked eagerly
round the kitchen; there were three or four men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
smoking, half a dozen women staring, and one very
old crone in a large white cap hunched up inside the
big chimney shook her stick at us, and gabbled in
Irish.</p>

<p>“Have you no place you could put us into?”
enquired my never-to-be-denied relative; “our car has
broken down—we really cannot remain in the road all
night; my niece has a dreadful cold. I am prepared,”
and she looked full into the woman’s eyes, and I knew
she was thinking of adventure, “to pay handsomely.”</p>

<p>“An’ what wud ye call handsome?” asked the
other, in a high, whining key.</p>

<p>“Say three pounds.”</p>

<p>“Is it three pounds? No, me lady. I really
couldn’t upset the house for that. What wud ye say
to six?—maybe then I’ll be talkin’ to ye—and let the
two men have an air of the fire, and give you and the
girleen a good bed between yees.”</p>

<p>“What—six pounds—for one night! Why, it’s
more than a London hotel.”</p>

<p>“Bedad, yes, I’m charging yees, because it’s <i>not</i> a
hotel, and for the raison that I’ll have to square it with
me Gran—for it’s <i>her</i> bed—ye might see her there in
the corner crouched up like an old wet hen. If ye will
just stand outside the door a couple of minutes, I’ll
argufy it out wid her—but she is terribly crabbed in
herself, and it’s like enough she’ll pull the head off
me!”</p>

<p>It was a novel and humiliating experience to be
turned out of doors, there to await a verdict—Watkin
and Jopp, too—and Jopp, who was young and foolish,
stared at his uncle and winked expressively.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, within, a fierce discussion raged; loud
sentences in an unknown tongue actually reached the
would-be guests; it sounded as if a furious quarrel
and real battle of words were taking place, with angry
shouts and stamping, but after ten minutes’ uproar the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
door was flung wide and the woman of the house
reappeared.</p>

<p>“I have it fixed up elegant! Walk in, if ye plase,
and welcome,” and she ushered our party into her
kitchen. The men stood up, and shuffled with their
feet, and, with Irish courtesy, extinguished their
pipes; the women stared, the old crone chattered like
an angry monkey, and pointed significantly to the
door.</p>

<p>Hot strong tea and hot well-buttered soda-bread
were offered, and found delicious.</p>

<p>“It will be extra, ye understand,” whispered the
hostess behind her hand, “two shilling—but I felt
sure ye’d be the better of a mouthful, whilst they were
redding up the room, and getting yer bed made.”</p>

<p>In ten minutes we were established in the bedroom,
which opened out of another apartment at the opposite
side of the front and only door, and was boarded,
white-washed, and looked, though bare, unexpectedly
possible. There was a wooden bed, a large green
wooden press, a chest of mahogany drawers, and
looking-glass, a washstand, and numerous religious
pictures nailed on the wall—at least four of the Blessed
Virgin and the Sacred Heart—over the bed hung a
large crucifix.</p>

<p>“We won’t take off all our clothes,” said my aunt,
as the door closed, “the sheets are sure to be damp—though
they are quite clean. I see she has left us
matches. Oh, what a luxury to lie down. B-r-r-r,
but the sheets are cold!” and she gave a shiver. To
me, the sheets felt as if they had been iced, but I was
too sleepy and tired to mind, and soon passed into the
land of dreams.</p>

<p>I think I must have been asleep three or four hours—it
seemed like three or four minutes—when I was
awakened by my aunt shaking me vigorously. She
was sitting up in bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“Millie—how you do sleep!” she said. “There’s
a noise in the press that awoke me. Listen!”</p>

<p>As I could hear nothing, I naturally asked:</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” she said impatiently. For a time there
was no sound. It seemed to me we were like two fools,
sitting up side by side in dead silence in the dark.</p>

<p>At last—yes!—certainly there was a movement in
the press—a sort of sliding and shuffling, a bump!</p>

<p>“There!” she exclaimed, hastily lighting the
candle. “You hear! Now I intend to see what it is.
It’s my opinion there’s a man in the wardrobe!”</p>

<p>As she spoke, my valiant aunt sprang out of bed,
candle in hand, turned a handle, and flung the door
wide open. Then she gave a loud quavering screech,
as something in the wardrobe toppled forward, and
fell upon her bodily.</p>

<p>I flew out of bed, just in time to see that the corpse
of a little wizened old man, in a brown wrapper—or
habit—had tumbled from the press, and lay at my
aunt’s feet; and in spite of my excellent hospital
training, for the moment I lost all self-control, and
screamed too!</p>

<p>Our united shrieks brought the assembled household
to the spot. The hostess burst in first, demanding:
“What’s this at all, at all?” Then as she
caught sight of the corpse, “Oh, Holy Fathers!
there’s for ye now!”</p>

<p>“An’ well served,” added another woman, thrusting
herself forward, “an’ serves ye right, Maggie
Behan, letting out the death-bed from under yer old
granddada for lucre—and the breath hardly out of
him, sure,” she continued in a shriller key and with
impassioned gestures. “It’s no wonder on earth the
poor old man made a disturbance and annoyance, and
come out of the press ye had him put away in. Faix,
never ye fear, he’ll have it <i>in</i> for ye yet!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>The body of the aged grandfather had, with my
assistance, now been lifted on to the bed from which
we had so unceremoniously ousted him.</p>

<p>“What does it all mean?” demanded my aunt,
speaking with as much dignity as was compatible with
a pair of black satin knickers; then snatching up a
skirt, she wound it hastily about her and boldly met
the eyes of half a dozen men, including her own
servants.</p>

<p>“Faix, then I’ll tell yer ladyship, and no lie about
it,” volunteered a little swarthy man; “him that’s dead
was me granddada—there’s herself in the kitchen.
He was mortial old; we were going to wake him—just
a small bit of a wake—when ye come, first yer man,
then yerself, and wouldn’t take no. Me wife felt bad
to be denying the two nice English ladies a bed, and
the bog air so cold—so—so—and seeing the money
was good, and wanted, we laid our heads together and
settled to turn out the old chap for the night—and
have our wake without him. Sure, don’t I know well
enough he’d be glad to accommodate any lady for six
sovereigns. We had a notion of puttin’ him up the
chimney, but for his new habit, and we made him all
right and tight in the press—but”—and he looked
round—“his legs give way. Ye see, he hasn’t the
use of them, this while back. Well, it’s all wan to
him, and I hope yer ladyship will take the bed at half-price—ye
had half a night, ye see. I give ye me
honour ’twas the best we could do for ye, and the
money will bury him elegant, and as for him disturbin’
ye, I’m sorry he didn’t let ye sleep it out.”</p>

<p>“If you will be so good as to withdraw, we will
dress,” said my aunt, who had recovered her self-possession;
“and if it is all the same to you, we’ll sit
in the kitchen till daybreak, and then perhaps you can
send us on a car to the junction.”</p>

<p>The remainder of that night we did sit in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
kitchen, drawn up within a large and hospitable circle.
Our hostess had not realised that there was a social
line of demarcation between our companions and ourselves;
my aunt and Watkin shared a form, and I sat
on a reversed turf-creel, squeezed in between Jopp and
Maggie Behan. Tea, whisky, and porter were in
steady circulation; a combination of porter and whisky
struck me as a novelty, but was evidently well known
to and highly appreciated by some of the company.
I am sure that but for my own embarrassing
proximity, Jopp would have liked to sample it.</p>

<p>As we sat there in the light of a huge turf-fire, I
learnt more of Ireland and listened to more wit and
good stories than I had ever done in my life. A tall,
red-haired man, called “Foxy Pat”—who seldom
smiled—kept, without the least apparent effort, and
with but two or three exceptions, the kitchen in a
roar. A couple who never laughed interested me
greatly: a girl of my own age, but quite beautiful,
the true Irish type, with black hair and wonderful
blue-black eyes; the other, a young man, equally
handsome, with some resemblance to the girl, straight
and broad-shouldered, with a nobly-set-on head, and
dark as a Spaniard. I noticed that they rarely spoke,
but gazed at one another from time to time; their
expression was so grave as to be almost tragic. In
answer to a whispered question, Maggie Behan
replied, also in a whisper:</p>

<p>“Them’s the two McCarthys—Norah and Dermot;
ye see, they can’t marry, being second cousins. He
is going to Ameriky on Monday—and sure, ye’ve
only to look at them to tell yerself as their two hearts
is broke.”</p>

<p>I must confess that this piece of information had
the effect of depressing my spirits to such an extent
that even the brilliance of Foxy Pat’s best story failed
to raise them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>As soon as the light began to creep in at the window
the gathering broke up, the wake—that was not a
wake; the wake where the corpse had been shut in a
press and its bed given to two ladies—was over. Aunt
Lizzie paid up the full price agreed upon, and we
partook of a parting cup of tea before we set out for
the station—a distance of eight miles. Thither we
were ignominiously conveyed on a turf-cart drawn by
a young irresponsible long-tail, and after a most
exciting drive, and several hairbreadth escapes,
arrived at the railway hotel in time for an early breakfast.
We had brought our bags with us, and mention
that we had had a breakdown on the way—but
not a word of our experience. Subsequently we
retired to bed, where we enjoyed several hours of undisturbed
repose. Late in the same afternoon the
motor turned up in good order, none the worse for its
night out—and the following day we started for
Queenstown, and home.</p>

<p>This was our only adventure in Ireland! Aunt
Lizzie—who thinks the whole incident too shocking
for words—has requested me never to mention it to a
soul; but I sometimes wonder if Watkin and Jopp
have been equally discreet.</p>

UNAVOIDABLY POSTPONED</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> white Orient liner lay in the harbour of
Colombo, with her Blue Peter flying. The coaling
process was accomplished, and her passengers—who
had lunched and scattered over the town and its
environs—were being thus summoned to abandon
Ceylon’s spicy breezes for the breezes of the sea.</p>

<p>As the <i>Oriana</i> was homeward bound from Melbourne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
naturally most of her freight were Australians—squatters
and their families taking a trip to the old
country, wealthy men from the big towns, tourists
who had been visiting the Colonies, parsons, actors,
doctors, engineers, with their corresponding women-folk.</p>

<p>And now a small Indian contingent had been contributed;
these the so-to-speak residents of three
weeks eyed with the same description of curiosity,
superiority, and faint hostility which schoolboys
experience with regard to new pupils.</p>

<p>Among the group of pale mem-sahibs, sunburnt
planters, children, ayahs and green parrots, was one
figure and face, well known, not merely to the captain
and officers, but to several of the passengers, who
hastened to offer the arrival a hearty greeting.</p>

<p>This individual was a certain popular sportsman
who roamed the world in search of big game and
“heads.” The Hon. Lumley Grantham was the only
son of Viscount Nesfield, and in a way the despair of
his parents, who were anxious that he should remain
at home and “settle,” instead of which he roved about
the globe, a modern wandering Jew (as sudden in his
arrivals and departures), energetic, enterprising, and
erratic. He had been in the Army, but the Service
did not accord sufficient leave to enable an ardent
sportsman to shoot in the Rockies, and to fish in New
Zealand; and so, after a few years’ restraint, he threw
off his uniform and unbuckled his sword. He had
a passion for trophies, and owned the most unique
and comprehensive collection of almost every known
horned animal, from a moose to a jungle sheep. To
add to his collection he spared neither effort nor
expense. If he heard some notable animal discussed
one evening at his club, such as a rare red bull in the
Shan Hills, a strange antelope in Borneo, the chances
were that he would immediately look up trains and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
steamers on the spot, and depart on his quest within
the week. His marches and stalkings beyond the
bounds of civilisation were fruitful in dangers and
hardships, and his mother, who was devoted to him,
lived in an agony of apprehension that some day,
instead of securing his object and prize, the prize
should turn the tables and make a prey of her only
son! For weeks and even months she did not hear
from him—he was probably in Thibet, Somaliland, or
Central America—and the unhappy lady would lie
awake for hours, thinking of “Must” elephants,
tigers, cholera, earthquakes and snakes. Oh, if Lumley
would only fall in love with some nice girl, marry
her, and stay at home, how happy and thankful she
would be; and she secretly vowed a window in their
country church, should this blessed event ever take
place. Lady Nesfield knew so many charming girls;
these she cautiously praised and brought to the notice
of Lumley; but, unfortunately, it is so seldom that a
young man and his mother admire the same girl; also
Lumley’s shooting proclivities had made him wary—he,
like Tennyson’s character, “saw the snare, and
he retired,” preferring his roving life, and freedom.</p>

<p>Lumley was now thirty-two years of age, but looked
older; tall, and without a superfluous ounce of flesh
on his bones, as wiry and sinewy as a greyhound; his
skin was brown, his short hair black, and two dark,
keen eyes illuminated a pleasant but not handsome
face. They were honest, watchful eyes, something
like those of an intelligent dog, and when they smiled
they became beautiful.</p>

<p>Captain Grantham’s manners were easy and unaffected;
he could find something to say to everyone,
from a royal duke to an Indian beater, and was equally
popular with all grades of society; a well-known
character on most liners, whether to the Cape,
America, Bombay, or Melbourne, he was, during his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
constant trips, continually coming across former
fellow-travellers.</p>

<p>On the present occasion, when he and his baggage
came up the side, Captain Grantham received quite an
ovation from half a dozen acquaintances. With one
or other of these he subsequently paced the deck, and
smoked and talked till the <i>Oriana</i> was well out to sea,
relating thrilling shikar stories, and his recent
exploits, with the gusto and enthusiasm of a schoolboy.
He described the hunting down and capture of
a big Rogue elephant in the Annamulley Jungle, and
the notable pair of ibex horns he had brought from the
Pulnay Hills.</p>

<p>After dinner, as he sat on deck in the starlight,
talking to a matronly acquaintance, he said:</p>

<p>“It seems a full ship—quite a number of girls, too—all
homeward bound.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, “and some of them pretty.
The two with the scarlet tam-o’-shanters are the Miss
Todds, heiresses from Woorolango. And the one in
the white yachting cap is said to be the belle of
Sydney.”</p>

<p>“And who is the dark girl who sits at the end of
the first officer’s table?”</p>

<p>“Beside a delicate lady with white hair and a bloodless
face? I do not know, except that they are Mrs.
and Miss Loftus, presumably mother and daughter.
The girl is devoted to the invalid, and never leaves
her side; they keep entirely to themselves.”</p>

<p>“Must be rather slow for the young lady?”</p>

<p>“No doubt it is; but when she is spoken to she
merely smiles and answers ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ Conversation
cannot flourish under such circumstances, can
it?”</p>

<p>“Do they know no one?”</p>

<p>“No. No one knows them, or who they are—which
amounts to the same thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“She is a handsome girl, with a thundering good
figure, and looks well-bred.”</p>

<p>“Appearances are sometimes deceitful!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that—one has an intuition——”</p>

<p>“I believe you are going to break the spell of
silence, and make the lady’s acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“Yes—why not?”</p>

<p>“Why not, indeed? But you will find it easier
said than done! She has never opened a conversation
with anyone during three weeks. I’ve even tried
to talk to her myself!”</p>

<p>“Ah! I see you are a little piqued.”</p>

<p>“I am not the only one who is piqued. I think the
damsel is inclined to give herself <i>airs</i>—we are possibly
not good enough—but I expect she will thaw to <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“Come now. I call that rather a nasty one, Mrs.
Seymour! What have I done to deserve it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—forgive me, and help me on with my
cape, and we will take a little turn before I turn in.
As for the Loftus party, they may have very good
reasons for keeping all at arm’s-length”—she paused
and stared at him significantly—“for not wishing to
know us, or us to know them,” and, as she spoke, the
lady rose from her chair, as if the subject were closed
and done with.</p>

<p>Like a true sportsman, Captain Grantham was
patient and pertinacious; he bided his time—but
biding one’s time on the trackless ocean, aboard a
fast liner, is not the same thing as tracking a quarry
in the pathless forest. There is a limit to postponement—a
limit represented by the port of arrival.</p>

<p>For several days he made no progress whatever,
beyond discovering that the lady was admired by the
men-folk, and suspected by the ladies, who, whilst
admitting the patent fact of her filial devotion, had
nothing to say in her favour. There was plenty to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
occupy the time among the passengers, and one sulky
girl was soon overlooked—but not by Captain Grantham.
She interested him; he was determined to make
her acquaintance, and luck favoured him—a sudden
lurch of the ship in the abominable current just off
Socotra capsized the old lady’s chair, and she would
have been hurled across the deck had he not dashed
to her assistance, caught her bodily in his arms, and
saved in all respects the situation. He took the entire
charge of Mrs. Loftus, personally conducted her to her
cabin, and subsequently collected books, spectacles,
shawl, and was thus brought into communication with
the young lady, and from that moment his object was
secured. She proved not at all <i lang="fr">difficile</i> once the ice
was broken, but a charming and captivating acquaintance.
After nearly four weeks’ silence, she seemed
anxious to make up for lost time, and talked incessantly;
she was also an admirable listener. Before
they had reached Suez she had largely extended her
acquaintance, and became as intimate with some of the
passengers as previously she had been remote. But
her first acquaintance was her chief ally; together they
paced the deck for exercise, together they did problems
in the papers, they played chess, and exchanged books
and opinions, and sat for a long time after dinner
watching the stars and the low tropical moon.</p>

<p>In the canal Captain Grantham, who was on the
“amusement committee,” helped to get up a grand
concert, and prevailed on Miss Loftus to sing. He
had gleaned from her mother that she had a fine voice,
and also a few other talents; as he sat beside the
invalid’s long chair, he discovered that she was ladylike
and refined; her surroundings indicated taste and
money.</p>

<p>Rata, as the girl was called, was her only child.
Mrs. Loftus was a widow returning to England, which
she had quitted twenty-eight years previously. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
husband’s people came from Gloucester, and were
nearly all dead.</p>

<p>She had lived near Christchurch, New Zealand,
and only been twice to England since she and her
husband had become colonists. Her brother had commanded
a well-known regiment and was now a
Brigadier in India.</p>

<p>Yes, Captain Grantham remembered to have seen
him some years previously, and here was a link
between them—such a very small matter will constitute
a tie on board ship, especially when both the ends
are anxious to be joined.</p>

<p>At the rehearsals for the concert, Miss Loftus discovered
to her listeners a magnificent contralto voice.
People vowed she was a second Melba; there was also
something that thrilled and touched one’s very heart-strings
in the expression of her rich, full notes.</p>

<p>The concert took place whilst the ship was in the
Canal, and the <i>Oriana</i> seemed motionless, as it wound
its way through the limitless sand; the concert was,
of course, packed, every seat was occupied. There
were the usual banjo and guitar ditties, men’s songs,
a glee; then Miss Loftus stood up, all in white, and,
without a note of music, sang “An Arab Love Song.”</p>

<p>The theme, which seemed peculiarly suitable to the
encompassing desert, had a weird and impressive
effect, and threw a momentary spell over the entire
audience. There was a wild, passionate note in the
singer’s voice that appealed to that something far
down, hidden away and stifled, that is born in every
human being.</p>

<p>All the world of the <i>Oriana</i> realised that they were
listening to a voice entirely out of the common, to
something unusual, unforgettable, and unique.</p>

<p>Miss Loftus presented a delightful picture; she was
good to look at, as she stood up in the moonlight on
the little platform—graceful, dignified, and yet so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
simple; last, by no means least, so undeniably handsome.</p>

<p>Her second song was a simple ballad, which caused
a lump to rise in the throats of her audience; but when
the last notes had died away among the sands, what
applause—real applause! Such was the uproar and
the acclamation, that a ship which was following
became extremely envious, and half inclined to
despatch a boat to inquire the reason of the unusual
demonstration.</p>

<p>A Mediterranean moon looks sympathetically on
lovers. What can be more romantic than those long,
idle evenings on that romantic sea? By the time
Malta was sighted, Lumley Grantham, the despair of
mothers (his own included), had proposed and been
accepted by Rata Loftus. Although they had only
known one another three weeks, time at sea means
ten times more than time on land. They had no distractions,
or occupation, spent at least twelve hours
of the day in each other’s society, and they had learnt
one another’s tastes and characters—so far as these
may be known before marriage. She listened eagerly
to his sporting adventures—he, to her descriptions of
New Zealand, her vivid little sketches of Colonial life,
her craving to see England and other countries, to
hear operas, concerts, and, above all, to visit Bayreuth
during the festival.</p>

<p>When the news of the engagement leaked out, it
was received on board with mixed feelings—but on
the whole the ship was pleased. It was a wonderful
catch for the girl; but she was handsome, accomplished,
and rich. Some of the women murmured
among themselves that, “for all anyone knew she
might be an adventuress! and the uncle, who was a
General, a fraud,” but they kept their suspicions to
themselves.</p>

<p>Mrs. Loftus now became more active; the voyage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
had revived her. She walked on deck, a little erect
figure with a stately pose of her white head, and even
discussed her plans with other ladies.</p>

<p>She proposed to make London her headquarters for
the present, to take a furnished house, and get Rata
presented—it was only March; there were sure to be
May drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>The happy couple—they were very much in love—went
ashore, and spent a day at Gibraltar in the
highest spirits, chaperoned by Mrs. Loftus. It was
surmised that they had despatched telegrams and
letters, and, at any rate, Miss Loftus wore a handsome
ring on her engaged finger when she returned
to the ship, loaded with gifts of fans, quaint bits of
Moorish ornaments, and a fine mantilla, which she
wore at a fancy ball two evenings later as a Spanish
lady, and looked a Spanish donna to the life. On
their arrival in London, Mrs. and Miss Loftus drove
straight to the Carlton Hotel, and Lumley Grantham
joined his family in Grosvenor Place.</p>

<p>The next day Lord and Lady Nesfield came to call
on the new arrivals, and their son’s future bride.</p>

<p>They were not a formidable couple: he, a tall, bent,
grey old man, with courteous manners; she, a pretty,
impulsive little woman, enchanted that Lumley had
chosen a wife at last, thankful for anyone, as long as
she was not black, and prepared to be delighted with
her daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>Rata for her part was much touched by their kind
welcome, and all now went merrily as a marriage bell.
Miss Loftus was handsome, healthy, ladylike; she had
£25,000—quite ample, as Lumley had no occasion to
marry a great fortune. Her mother was a refined and
amiable woman, passionately devoted to her only
child, and the attachment was most warmly returned.
Rata was a girl of strong feelings, and it was patent
to all that she was deeply in love with her <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>. Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Loftus, who was evidently a woman of wealth, was
soon established in a fashionable house at Lowndes
Square, with a smart carriage and an adequate staff,
and all Lumley Grantham’s relatives and connections,
male and female, crowded to call upon the lady of his
choice.</p>

<p>They found her as handsome, graceful, and agreeable
as they were led to expect, but perhaps a little
unconventional and colonial. With respect to her
voice, there could be but one opinion. She was a
serious loss to the musical world, and could have made
a fortune as a great <i lang="it">prima donna</i>. Invitations were
showered upon 225, Lowndes Square. Miss Loftus
was in continual request, and soon became a social
favourite. She was a magnificent horsewoman, and
rode every morning in the Row, accompanied by
Captain Grantham.</p>

<p>Among the chorus of praise were a few discordant
notes; the loudest and shrillest of these issued from
the Hon. Mrs. Custance, Lord Nesfield’s only sister,
a lady in somewhat narrow circumstances, with two
tall, talkative daughters. Her view’s were not rigid
respecting the marrying of first cousins, and Lumley’s
engagement had been a shock to her, for she had
always hoped that he would one day settle down, and
marry either Maudie or Mag, instead of which he presented
as <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> a Colonial nobody, whom he had, so
to speak, picked up at sea! <i>Who</i> was she? This was
a question continually on her lips.</p>

<p>The Loftus family were undoubtedly respectable,
but how was anyone to know she was one of them?
And the uncle, a General, was possibly a myth.
These people had no friends in London, and did not
seem to know a soul.</p>

<p>But for all these objections Lady Nesfield found
satisfactory replies. She was delighted at her son’s
capture—now he would be chained fast, and kept at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
home. General Broome had written his congratulations,
and was sending a present. Two of the
Custance girls were to be bridesmaids; the wedding
would take place in July, as the bride’s mother was
in precarious health, and anxious to see her daughter
happily married, as she believed—so she told Lady
Nesfield in confidence—that her own days were numbered,
and she could not bear the idea of leaving Rata
alone in the world.</p>

<p>At the present moment she had rallied sufficiently
to be able to accompany her girl to the park, the play,
and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The questions of Mrs. Custance were also on the
lips and in the mind of Lady Foxrock, Lumley Grantham’s
only sister. She was undeniably one of the
smart set. The childless wife of a wealthy old peer,
ambition was her fetish, and, in spite of her passion
for bridge, motoring, and racing, she still contrived
to find time for the casting of social nets, and for
bringing important intimacies into the family circle.
She had always resolved that Lumley, “the wild
hunter,” as she playfully called him, should marry—when
he <i>did</i> take the step—to the advantage of his
family, and she had mentally selected one of her exclusive
friends, the rather <i lang="fr">passée</i> daughter of a noble
duke, with a splendid connection, and a considerable
dower. She never dreamt, for one moment, that Lumley
would find anything more attractive abroad than
his usual horns, tusks, and skins; but home he came
with a bride, so to speak, in his hand—a mere colonial
nobody. Lady Foxrock took an invincible dislike to
her on the spot—the dislike was mutual. Rata felt
herself an antagonist to this tall, sour-looking lady,
with a thin, high nose, pale, arrogant eyes, and slow,
disdainful airs. Lady Foxrock could not understand
why men admired the colonial; in her opinion, she was
frightfully second-rate. And who <i>was</i> she? How,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
she asked her mother, did they know she was related
to the Gloucestershire people? The uncle in India
was probably a fiction! The girl had no friends in
London and, for all that they could tell, might be an
adventuress. Lumley’s interests must be watched—he
was an <i>idiot</i>, where that girl was concerned.</p>

<p>Naturally Lady Foxrock had been indefatigable
in her endeavours to discover something about the
Loftuses, but, unfortunately, New Zealand was
remote, and her acquaintances in the Colonies were
limited, and she had a confused idea that people who
lived in Melbourne or Sydney must, as a matter of
course, be intimate with those in Christchurch and
Wellington!</p>

<p>One sleepy afternoon, at Hurlingham, kind fate
placed a clue in her hand. She was sitting in one of
the little tents on the lawn, enjoying tea and strawberries;
her near neighbours were a large merry party
of acquaintances, and they gradually intermixed.
Among the group was a grey-haired, square-built
gentleman, who was presented to her as Mr. Dexter,
spending a few months in England after an absence
of thirty years. Lady Foxrock surveyed him
critically; his clothes were ill-fitting, his gloves preposterous,
but his carriage, square chin, and keen
eyes, gave indication of a man of character, and
importance.</p>

<p>He sank into a chair beside the lady, and said, “It
is a pretty scene,” nodding his head at the numerous
gay groups, the passing crowd, the lawn scattered
with flower-beds, the tall trees, through which
shimmered the river.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’ve seen it so often,” she drawled, “its
charm has faded a little.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, if you had been thirty years in the
colonies you would not complain of <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, really, I suppose not,” she answered indifferently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
her attention diverted by the sight of her
brother, his <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>, Mrs. Loftus, and Lady Nesfield,
who were then passing. She noticed that her companion
started and stared hard; he even leant forward
and gazed after the group; then, as he met her glance
of interrogation, he said, “I’ve just seen a familiar
face—a face from home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then you are from New Zealand,” she exclaimed,
“and have recognised Mrs. and Miss
Loftus?”</p>

<p>“Ah,” he answered, “so you know them?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and you?”</p>

<p>“Very intimately once; but eighteen years ago they
left our neighbourhood, and I entirely lost sight of
them.”</p>

<p>“Who <i>was</i> Mr. Loftus?” she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“A prosperous gentleman who owned several large
ranches, and died a year ago, leaving a fortune.”</p>

<p>“Was he of good birth?”</p>

<p>“I should say so—but we don’t take much account
of that in the Colonies, you know.”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Loftus?”</p>

<p>“She was renowned for her philanthropy and
charities. She had no children——”</p>

<p>“What! No children! She has a daughter—you
saw her just now.”</p>

<p>“An adopted daughter,” he corrected.</p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>

<p>“I assure you it is the case; there was no secret
about it.”</p>

<p>“There is a secret about it <i>now</i>.”</p>

<p>“You seem interested in the family.”</p>

<p>“I should think I am, considering that Miss Loftus
is going to marry my brother—Lord Nesfield’s only
son.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” he exclaimed, in unfeigned
amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“But I do—the wedding is fixed to take place in
ten days’ time. Shall we go outside this tent, and
stroll about a little?—impossible to talk here.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” and he moved a chair out of her way,
and followed Lady Foxrock down towards the polo
ground.</p>

<p>“I suppose there is no mistake, Mr. Dexter,” she
began, “and you really recognise these people?”</p>

<p>“I recognise Mrs. Loftus. I could swear to her
anywhere, to her white face and prominent blue eyes.
The girl was only two, when I last saw her, but I
believe her to be the same. She was very handsome,
and her name, I believe, was Rata—named after a
New Zealand flower.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is Rata.”</p>

<p>“There never was any concealment or mystery
respecting her. The Loftuses had no family. They
were passionately fond of children, and they adopted
a child, and, a short time after this, they moved away
to the south island; and we lost sight of them.”</p>

<p>“Do you know who the child was?”</p>

<p>“Well”—with obvious reluctance—“yes, I do.”</p>

<p>“You will tell me, won’t you?” and she flashed on
him a challenging glance from her small grey eyes.</p>

<p>A moment’s silence. At last he said, “No; I
would rather not. It is not my business, and you
must excuse me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Dexter, <i>won’t</i> you speak out? It means
so much to <i>us</i>.”</p>

<p>“There is absolutely nothing against the girl’s
character. I think I can assure you of that.”</p>

<p>“Then it is her <i>birth</i>—that is the question.”</p>

<p>“Well, she is not responsible for that, is she?”</p>

<p>“No-o,” the negative was reluctant.</p>

<p>“She seems a fine, tall, beautiful young woman,
and I’m sure she has been well brought up; she will
be wealthy—what more do you want?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“The truth, and nothing but the truth.”</p>

<p>“It is not always advisable to know the truth—sometimes
silence is best.”</p>

<p>“And so you won’t speak,” she said impatiently,
“you are inflexible?”</p>

<p>He bowed his head.</p>

<p>“Look here; we are just coming face to face with
the party. Will you accost them?”</p>

<p>“No; I prefer not—unless Mrs. Loftus recognises
me.”</p>

<p>They approached in a line, the two younger people
handsome and radiant—Rata all in white, carrying a
becoming pink sunshade—the elder ladies deep in
mutual confidences. Little did they suspect that the
smiling lady in grey, who had accosted them in
passing, was elaborating a scheme which was to upset
their happy anticipations.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Dexter,” said Lady Foxrock, “I see
you are a man of honour, and respect the affairs of
other people, and I must say, that, <i>much</i> as I should
like to know something about my future sister-in-law,
I admire your reticence immensely. We will consider
our talk strictly confidential. Are you married?”</p>

<p>“Yes; that was my wife with the Greysons—the
little woman in the blue toque.”</p>

<p>“You won’t mention the subject to her, will you?”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not. The less said the better.”</p>

<p>“Where are you staying?”</p>

<p>“At the Hyde Park Hotel—for a couple of weeks.
We have not many friends in London.”</p>

<p>“Then I should like to do myself the pleasure of
calling on Mrs. Dexter.”</p>

<p>“That is really very kind of you. I am sure she
will be delighted to make your acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“And now,” said the lady, “we must go and look
for our parties. They will think we are lost.”</p>

<p>Lady Foxrock was prompt in calling on Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Dexter. She found her twenty years younger than
her husband, and of a much inferior class—a yellow-haired,
shallow, over-dressed little person, who was
obviously flattered by a visit from her ladyship.</p>

<p>Her ladyship dangled some imposing invitations
before her dazzled eyes, and then began to ask
cautious questions about New Zealand.</p>

<p>Yes, she was New Zealand born herself, not long
married—she had insisted on Joe taking her to England,
for a spree like! She wanted to see the world
a bit, and society. He had brought her, though all
his own folk were dead—and he had no home
now.</p>

<p>Had Mrs. Dexter ever heard of a Mrs. Loftus in her
part of the world?</p>

<p>Yes, ages ago—she’d almost forgotten the tale.</p>

<p>“Oh, so there was a tale. How very interesting!
Has it anything to do with her adopted daughter?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dexter nodded, and giggled.</p>

<p>“The girl is in England now, you know, with
Mrs. Loftus—and about to make a grand match.”</p>

<p>Lady Foxrock had touched the right chord; the
little colonial was filled with a sudden spasm of envy.</p>

<p>“A splendid match—<i>she</i>!”</p>

<p>“Yes, to the son of a lord.”</p>

<p>“Oh—what!” and she burst out into an excited
laugh. “Well, I declare, this is too fine a joke. If
they only knew—wouldn’t they be wild!”</p>

<p>“Knew what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d better not say—it might get out. I don’t
want to be a spoil-sport; and Joe hates what he calls
‘gossip,’” and she put her finger on her lips.</p>

<p>Lady Foxrock drew herself up and looked dignified.
“I assure you that I never gossip, Mrs. Dexter. If
you can tell me who this girl was, and is, you will be
doing me an enormous favour, and one I shall not
forget; but, of course, if you feel that you have no wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
to confide in me—and after all I am a stranger——”
she paused, and her smile implied a threat.</p>

<p>After all, she was Lady Foxrock, and if she was
denied this small request, good-bye to a box at the
Opera, an invitation for Lady Foxrock’s fancy ball—and
other delights.</p>

<p>“Well, then, look here; I <i>will</i> tell you,” and she
suddenly leant forward. Her visitor also approached
her head, her heart beat fast—these moments are the
sparks of life!</p>

<p>“Miss Loftus, the adopted daughter of Mrs. Loftus,
is just a——”</p>

<p>There was a footstep outside.</p>

<p>“Hark! my husband is coming!”</p>

<p>“Quick, quick, you must tell me!” cried Lady
Foxrock, seizing her arm in an agony of suspense.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dexter once again leant forward, and whispered,
and, ere her whispering had ceased, the handle
rattled, and the two heads started apart, as the door
opened and Mr. Dexter entered the room.</p>

<p>His wife had entirely recovered her self-possession
and said, with incredible assurance, “Oh, there you
are, dear. I’m so glad you’ve come in while Lady
Foxrock is here.”</p>

<p>He advanced with broad, extended palm. Lady
Foxrock, who seemed embarrassed, and strangely
flushed, said:</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve paid, you see, my threatened visit to
your wife, and now”—rising as she spoke—“I must
positively be going. I’m such a busy person, my
quarters of an hour are all filled up.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry I did not come home a little sooner,”
said Joe Dexter, who saw that his wife was flattered
and gratified, and felt proportionately pleased.</p>

<p>“I will send the cards to-morrow,” continued Lady
Foxrock, “and I shall hope to see you both on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
29th,” and with a gracious handshake her ladyship
swept out.</p>

<p>Once seated in her carriage, she felt herself
trembling with excitement; a few civil words, a card
of invitation, what had they not brought her? The
match between Lumley and the New Zealander was
practically broken off—in a few hours the notification
would appear in the <i>Morning Post</i>!</p>

<p>She was determined to strike at once—no time like
the present, and no time to be lost. She ordered her
footman to drive to Lowndes Square.</p>

<p>Mrs. Loftus was at home, resting on the sofa in
the back drawing-room. She had had an unusually
fatiguing day, and looked ghastly as she struggled to
her feet to receive Lady Foxrock. Her ladyship,
being Lumley’s sister, had the <i lang="fr">entrée</i> at all hours to
the temporary home of his <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>. Yet Lady Foxrock
was antipathetic to both Rata and her mother.
She was cold, arrogant, interfering, and inquisitive—it
seemed almost impossible that she could have
been born a Nesfield!</p>

<p>“It is a little late,” she said, glancing at a clock,
“but I could not have slept to-night if I had not
come to see you. I want to ask you something
important about—Rata.”</p>

<p>The lady’s manner was menacing, and at the conclusion
of her sentence the eyes of her hostess
resembled those of some long-hunted animal, that the
cruel hunter has tracked to its lair at last!</p>

<p>“What about Rata?” she faltered, as she sank into
a seat; her hands were shaking visibly.</p>

<p>“Yes, what about Rata?” echoed a full, gay voice.
“Talk of an angel, and here I am!” she added playfully
as she advanced, a delightful vision in a summer
gown and flowery hat.</p>

<p>“Darling,” cried Mrs. Loftus, “run away for a
little. Lady Foxrock wishes to speak about you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“But, dearest, if Leonora is going to talk about <i>me</i>,
don’t you think you are rather cruel to banish me?
Curiosity is one of my strongest characteristics!”</p>

<p>“Enough of this nonsense,” thought the visitor,
and, turning roughly on Mrs. Loftus, she said, “I
wish Rata to remain here—it is essential”; and then,
turning quickly to Rata, she added, “If you are so
naturally inquisitive, has it never occurred to you to
wonder who you are?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!” murmured Mrs. Loftus under her
breath, “it has come! Rata, as you love me, leave
me here alone with Lady Foxrock,” and she half rose
and stretched out an appealing arm.</p>

<p>“No, dearest; if there is going to be trouble, I will
stand by you. As to wondering who I am, Leonora,”
now facing the lady, “why should I, when I know
that I am Rata Loftus?”</p>

<p>“By all accounts, you have cherished a delusion.
You are no more to Mrs. Loftus than to me—you are
an adopted child. Mrs. Loftus adopted you, when
you were two years old.”</p>

<p>“Well, even so, she <i>is</i> my mother,” coming over
and taking her hand. “I could not love her more if
she were ten times my mother.” And she raised her
eyes defiantly to Lady Foxrock.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes,” faltered the miserable Mrs. Loftus.
“Yes, darling; you are not my <i>real</i> child. I hoped
you would never, never know—and now!”—looking
at Lady Foxrock—“is not <i>that</i> enough? Rata has
always been to Edgar and me as our very, very own.”</p>

<p>“Enough!” echoed the visitor, “no, not nearly
enough—not half enough. The girl should be made
acquainted with her own race. Do you think I will
stand by in silence and allow my only brother, the
future head of the family, to marry a <i>Maori</i>?”</p>

<p>“A Maori! What nonsense!” cried Rata indignantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Nevertheless, your own grandfather is still
living,” she continued inexorably. “He is a chief
called Ramparaha, and resides in a ‘Pa’——”</p>

<p>“There! you have killed her!” screamed the girl,
rushing forward and catching Mrs. Loftus in her
arms. Mrs. Loftus, whose blanched face had, during
the above conversation, assumed a death-like hue, and
who now collapsed without a word into a heap upon
the sofa.</p>

<p>It was a dead faint indeed. Having laid her down
and unfastened the neck of her dress, Rata dashed to
the bell.</p>

<p>Then as she returned to the invalid she said, “I
think you had better go—you have done your worst.”</p>

<p>“I have done my <i>best</i> for my brother,” answered
Lady Foxrock fiercely. “I am sorry your patroness
has fainted—she would have kept the secret always, to
her very last hour; what I have stated is true—and
can be proved.”</p>

<p>“Mother—mother,” murmured the girl, as she
rubbed the cold hands. Then to a servant, “Run
for the nearest doctor, and send some brandy. Mrs.
Loftus is very ill; and let someone show this lady
out.”</p>

<p>Lady Foxrock’s words were prophetic, for Mrs.
Loftus had kept her secret to her dying hour. When
the doctor and the brandy arrived, she was past all
human aid.</p>

<p>It appeared that she had a most dangerous form of
heart disease, and it was a marvel she had survived
for so long.</p>

<p>Rata was stunned—she had sustained two violent
shocks within the same hour: the announcement of
her parentage, and the loss of her mother.</p>

<p>Her grief was at first as wild and uncontrollable as
that of one of her savage ancestors; then she became
as a creature of stone, and shut herself up from all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
eyes, like some wounded animal, who would suffer
alone. Lady Nesfield and Lumley were all sympathy
and affection—they did not yet know the truth. Lord
Nesfield undertook the funeral arrangements and Lady
Nesfield—who could not prevail on Rata to leave the
house—offered to take up her quarters in Lowndes
Square; but this Rata declined. She and her sorrow,
her anguish, and her fears were sufficient company for
one another. The day after the funeral, a paragraph
to this effect appeared among the fashionable intelligence:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Owing to the sudden death of Mrs. Loftus, the marriage
of Miss Loftus and Captain the Hon. Lumley
Grantham, fixed for the 13th inst., is unavoidably postponed.”</p>
</div>

<p>When affairs were returning to their normal course,
Lady Foxrock made her parents and her brother
acquainted with the result of her investigations into
the past of their future relation. At first their amazement
transcended expression. The intelligence fell
like a moral avalanche; they were all three stunned by
the information.</p>

<p>“A Maori!” they repeated; “a Maori—a <i>Maori</i>!”</p>

<p>“But she is so accomplished and graceful, and
sings so splendidly,” argued Lady Nesfield.</p>

<p>“I believe many Maori women are graceful, and
have fine voices.”</p>

<p>“And so <i>fair</i>,” objected his lordship.</p>

<p>“Her father was an Englishman.”</p>

<p>“And she never knew this till the other day. Oh,
poor child!”</p>

<p>“The discovery you made killed the old lady,”
added Lord Nesfield.</p>

<p>“It certainly hastened her end,” she admitted;
“but, according to the doctors, she <i>ought</i> to have died
years ago; in fact, it was a miracle she lived so long!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“It is an extraordinary affair,” exclaimed her
father, “a most terrible disclosure—it seems incredible;
and that such a—I may say—unheard-of
catastrophe should occur in <i>our</i> family——”</p>

<p>His family, his pedigree, was Lord Nesfield’s
pride; a long descent stirred his enthusiasm; before
all things in the world he respected blue blood. His
ancestors had fought at Cressy and Poitiers—he
claimed descent from Henry the Seventh; that his
only son and heir should marry a Maori woman—the
descendant of cannibals and savages! Never. He
was sorry for Lumley and the girl, but his resolution
was embodied in the word <i>never</i>.</p>

<p>When Rata permitted Lady Nesfield to see her, she
realised by instinct that she was acquainted with her
story, although not a word was uttered. And Lumley—he
knew also. He called to see her daily, and sent
her flowers and notes, but she still remained mute and
invisible.</p>

<p>At last she reappeared and granted him an audience
in the drawing-room. But here was a Rata he had
never seen before, dressed in trailing black, and
looking worn, hollow-eyed, and aged.</p>

<p>He felt as if this girl were a stranger.</p>

<p>“No, no; don’t kiss me, Lumley,” she protested.
“Sit down in that chair, and let me talk to you. In
the first place, I wish to show you a letter. In my—in—Mrs.
Loftus’s despatch-box I found this
addressed to me, and inscribed, ‘To be opened after
my death.’ It will tell you everything you ought to
know.”</p>

<p>He glanced at the letter in his hand. It began:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dearest Rata</span>,</p>

<p>“When your eyes read these words I shall be no more,
and I am now about to tell you what I never imparted
to you in life. You are not my own child, but my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
adopted daughter. Your parentage will startle you, my
dear; you were born in a Maori ‘Pa’ near Wellington.
I saw you there, a lovely, fair baby of two years old, fell
in love with you, and, after a little time persuaded your
grandfather, Ramparaha, chief of a great tribe, to give
you to me, to bring up absolutely as my own. You were
an orphan, and he had other grandchildren. Your father
was an Englishman of good birth—needless to tell you
his name. Your mother was the most beautiful girl of
her race in the whole of the North Island. They were
married by a priest, and by the rites of her tribe. Not
long afterwards he was drowned in the lake Tavatara;
your mother died in giving you birth, and that is your
history. We never regretted the step we took—you were
always our joy and comfort. We moved away from the
neighbourhood of Wellington, and brought you up as an
English girl; you have not one Maori trait in your
character. I feel that my life hangs by a thread, and I
intend to take you to Europe, where I hope you may make
friends, and possibly marry. Once you have won the love
of a good man, who will be your protector and guardian,
I am ready to depart in peace. He will have to be told
the truth some day, when you are his wife, and, if he
loves you, it can make no difference.</p>

<p>“My will, enclosed with this letter, was drawn up in
New Zealand, and is perfectly legal, and formal. In it
I speak of you as Rata, my adopted daughter, and leave
you all I possess. Make good use of this wealth, dear
child, and be happy.”</p>
</div>

<p>When Lumley Grantham came to the end of this
letter he looked up, and met the eyes of his <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>,
and for some seconds they surveyed one another in
silence. She was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“It makes a difference—a terrible difference,
Lumley, does it not?”</p>

<p>“But <i>you</i> are not changed.”</p>

<p>“I am—I am a Maori. Imagine it! A Maori! I
seem to feel different—to summon up strange, dim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
dreams. A tall old man with feathers on his head—yes—of
a low, dark hut with smoke——”</p>

<p>“No—no,” protested Lumley, “that is your
imagination. Your nerves have gone to pieces.”</p>

<p>“And I would always be thinking of <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>The man felt curiously embarrassed—the girl was
so matter-of-fact, so unlike herself; there was something
unfamiliar, and almost stern about her.</p>

<p>“Your father is, of course, overwhelmed by the
news,” she resumed. “I remember he asked to see
the Loftus’s pedigree—think of my pedigree! Tell
me, what does he say? Oh, speak to me <i>plainly</i>—he
will not have me as a daughter-in-law?”</p>

<p>“He likes you personally, Rata, so does my
mother; you know that, but—but——”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a tremendous but—an impassable but—I
understand.”</p>

<p>“Of course it will never be known beyond ourselves.”</p>

<p>“It will,” she interrupted. “My mother hugged
herself with the same delusion—yet the secret crept
out—and killed her!”</p>

<p>“It shall not kill us,” he answered slowly. “We
will, on the contrary, smother and bury it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, easier said than done! Now tell me frankly,
Lumley, what are your family proposing to do with
me?”</p>

<p>“To find you a nice lady companion, and let you
travel for a bit.”</p>

<p>“Yes—and then?”</p>

<p>“Well, I——” he stammered, “I’m not sure that
they suggested anything further. To be honest, my
father will not hear of our marriage. My mother is
heartbroken; but she, too, is against it. Leonora—is—is——”</p>

<p>“Triumphant! That is understood. And you,
Lumley?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“I am ready to marry you to-morrow. I love you,
Rata. Of course you come first of all; but I do not
wish to quarrel with my father, or break my mother’s
heart. It seems so hard to hit on the right thing,
and decide. I want a good think—all by myself. I
will go off alone to-morrow morning into the country,
and come back and tell you what the result is, and
then we can make our plans.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“What time shall I come—may I say four
o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then four o’clock to-morrow without fail.”</p>

<p>Rata awaited the appointed hour—which meant so
much to her—with feverish impatience; long before
the time she was pacing the drawing-room and
watching the timepiece. Did Lumley mean to
abandon her? Was the suggestion of travelling on
the Continent but the preliminary to a final farewell?
Had he not been confused, embarrassed, unlike himself,
and cold, when they had met the previous day,
although his sympathy for her loss had seemed truly
real and sincere? With these thoughts forming and
glowing in her brain she worked herself into a condition
of the highest mental tension. Four o’clock—half-past
five—and no Lumley; he who was so true
to his word, and so punctual! What did it mean?
It meant, that he had decided against her, and dared
not venture to announce the fact face to face.</p>

<p>After this came the agonies of waiting for the postman’s
knock. No letter, not a line from him. All
that night she lay wide awake, thinking for herself,
and enduring a mental torture such as she had never
dreamt of—it was ten times worse than mere physical
pain. So Lumley was lost to her—as well as her
mother. She had not a relation in Europe, and was
practically alone in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>The following day came and passed with leaden
feet. It brought piles of cards of condolence and
inquiries. There were letters from dressmakers,
milliners, and shops, papers, circulars, notes from
acquaintances, legal looking documents—not a sign
from Lumley. Oh, it was too cruel of him to torture
her like this! About five o’clock, she relinquished
all hope and made up her mind to act for herself.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Lumley Grantham had taken his bicycle by rail
down to Croydon, and started for a long, solitary spin.
He always enjoyed his own society, and could not
exist without plenty of exercise, and, as he skimmed
along the country roads, his brain was hard at work,
sorting out the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of an extremely difficult
situation. He was resolved to marry Rata—to that
point his mind was anchored—but in deference to his
father’s sensibilities he felt that he was bound to do
nothing suddenly. He and Rata must wait; time
would soften the sharp edge of the shock that his
parents had sustained. Rata could travel; she had
never seen the Continent. He would run out to South
Africa for a few months—and possibly by Christmas....
Here his bicycle ran over a loose stone—he
lost his balance and fell heavily on his head. An
hour later, he was found by a farmer’s carter, taken
to the farm, and there laid, still insensible, under the
shade of the best four-poster. A doctor was summoned,
and announced slight concussion of the brain,
and rest essential; but it was two days before the
traveller was fit to return to London. His mother—accustomed
to his erratic departures—was only
slightly concerned—and hailed his reappearance with
relief.</p>

<p>Two days after his appointment, he arrived to keep
it, but found, to his surprise, that Miss Loftus was
not at home, and the household seemed a little upset.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Miss Loftus had departed that morning in a four-wheeler,
taking a small box and a bag with her, and
leaving her maid without any instructions. She had
not mentioned when she proposed to return.</p>

<p>And as it turned out, Miss Loftus never did return.
She had walked out of the house, and abandoned her
belongings, all her jewellery, including engagement
ring, letters, papers, personal possessions, and the
will of the late Mrs. Loftus.</p>

<p>Presently the family lawyers arrived, and dismissed
the servants, gave up the house, and set about tracing
the heiress. But she seemed to have vanished, as it
were, into the air. Lord Nesfield was agreeably and
obviously relieved, until he was assured by his son
that, unless the lost lady was found, he would never
marry, and this statement considerably modified his
joy, for Lord Nesfield disliked his next heirs, the Nesfields
of Barlow, even more intensely than the idea of
a daughter-in-law with <i>strange</i> blood in her veins!</p>

<p>Lumley Grantham, after fruitless visits, first to
Gloucestershire, and then Lahore, finally set out for
New Zealand, “the wonderland of the world,” with
its mountains, glaciers, waterfalls, and lakes. Here
it took some time tracing a lady who, three months
previously, had landed at Dunedin; but he tracked
her steps patiently, and at last discovered that she had
disappeared among a Maori tribe near Kaiapui in the
lake country. Here he sought the great “Pa” of the
chief Ramparaha, and found him, the splendid wreck
of a fine Maori warrior, wrapped in a cloak of feathers,
his head adorned with the plumes of authority, enjoying
a long pipe in the door of his abode. Around
were various Maori women, young and old, with thick,
grizzly black hair and tall, graceful figures, dressed,
as is the present custom, in skirts and blouses, instead
of their picturesque native costumes. A few fine, stalwart
men were loitering about, smoking and talking.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Over them all lay the spell of unconquerable indolence—children,
dogs, and flies were the only objects
endowed with vitality.</p>

<p>In reply to Captain Grantham’s question, the chief
replied, “Yes, one white woman come here two moons
ago—my daughter’s daughter, she said—but she was
all English. Her mother was Tassila the beautiful,
who died young. I gave her baby to a lady from
Wellington. Twenty years after the baby comes back
to the tribe; but she is a stranger.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course she is,” assented his visitor, with
emphasis.</p>

<p>“She liked not our food, nor our ways, although we
held a Tangi in her honour and gave <i lang="mi">poi deones</i> and
<i lang="mi">hakas</i>. She would not even <i>look</i>—also she knew not
our tongue. She sat all day alone in her hut and
wept, and ate nought, and grew thin, oh, so thin—and
then she—as was best—left us.”</p>

<p>“Where is she?” enquired Captain Grantham
eagerly; “you know?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” gravely nodding his plumed head, “I
know.”</p>

<p>“And will you take me—will you show me?”</p>

<p>“Why do you seek her?”</p>

<p>“Because she and I were to have been married, and
I have come to fetch her back to England.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” rising stiffly, “and so you were to marry
my granddaughter Rata. Then follow me, and I will
show you where she is.”</p>

<p>And Ramparaha, the lineal descendant of the great
Tuahariri, led the way through the surrounding
<i lang="mi">raupo</i>, or scrub, up a very steep hill, from the summit
of which was a view of considerable extent.</p>

<p>“You see that big lake?” he said, pointing his
shrivelled hand towards a melancholy sheet of distant
water, in which the mountains were darkly reflected.
“She is always staring at the water—some day it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
take her. Her heart is not here—but in her father’s
country.”</p>

<p>As Ramparaha spoke, they reached a solitary
wattled hut, and in reply to a call, the ghost of Rata
appeared in the doorway. She was incredibly
changed—robbed of every trace of beauty, worn and
emaciated—and wore a Maori skirt, and jacket, her
masses of hair hanging down her back. At first, she
looked dazed, and startled; then her black eyes took
a fierce expression, as she surveyed her grandfather’s
companion in expressive silence.</p>

<p>“I have come to fetch you, Rata,” he said.</p>

<p>“The last time—you never came—you—<i>deserted</i>
me,” she answered hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Rata, I could not help it—I met with an accident
and was unconscious for days. When I recovered
you were gone—and I have searched the world for
you! Will you believe me, and come home?”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, the befeathered old chief gave an
audible grunt of satisfaction and relief, as he beheld
his granddaughter and the Englishman walk down the
hill together hand in hand.</p>

THE NORTH VERANDAH</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A chance</span> meeting in the hall of a Swiss hotel, in the
vicinity of the visitors’ book, a polite “After you,”
and a similarity of surnames led to our acquaintance
with two charming Americans. The acquaintance
ripened into friendship, and ultimately my sister Lucy
and self discovered that Mrs. Washington-Dormer
and her son Philip were connected with our family,
and that we, the Dormers of Ashley Gardens, Victoria,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
London, S.W., were cousins (several times
removed) of our namesakes of Rochelle, near Lexington,
Kentucky, U.S.A.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dormer was a widow with a good figure, snow-white
hair, and a bright, intelligent face. She had
also a cheerful manner, and an air of suppressed
energy. Having confessed to the national passion for
old places, old curiosities and old pedigrees, she set
to work to examine our family tree, from which it
appeared that a certain relative had emigrated in the
year 1810, settled, married and founded a dynasty in
that State, so worthily celebrated for its thoroughbred
horses and blue grass.</p>

<p>In company of “Cousin” Carolina and “Cousin”
Philip, we travelled through Northern Italy and the
Tyrol with mutual enjoyment, and before we separated
in Paris had entered into a solemn league and covenant
to visit our Kentucky cousins in the early “fall.”
I was rather astonished at the alacrity with which
Lucy accepted this invitation—knowing that she was
a hopelessly bad sailor and how she hated the sea!
It, however, dawned on me that she liked Cousin
Philip, and the least observant could see that he worshipped
her.</p>

<p>Behold us therefore arrived and happily established
at Rochelle, a stately old “colonial” house which,
with its pillared verandahs on all four sides, presented
a dignified appearance in the midst of spreading turf
lawns (the beautiful blue grass), avenues of walnut
trees, and clumps of oak and hickory.</p>

<p>In former days, Rochelle had been surrounded by
an immense estate, worked by slaves who raised and
gathered vast crops of hemp, tobacco, and corn; but
now the shrunken acreage was chiefly devoted to the
breeding and rearing of horses; for these Cousin
Philip enjoyed a reputation that extended from New
York to New Orleans. My sister Lucy was in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
element, being a fearless rider and a capital whip;
Cousin Carolina, too, was an admirable horsewoman,
despite her fifty years. The days were spent in
driving-racing trotters, galloping young thoroughbreds,
visiting distant runs, and inspecting rival
stables. These joys were not for <i>me</i>! I am naturally
timid, a shameless coward where horses are concerned,
distrustful of distant cows, and all strange dogs. I
believe mine is what is termed “the artistic temperament”
(I paint and write poetry), yet I have a certain
queer courage of my own. For instance, I am not
afraid to discharge a servant, to venture alone into a
dark room, and have no belief in ghosts. When my
sister, cousins, and their friends scoured the neighbourhood,
I remained contentedly at Rochelle,
sketching the best “bits” of scenery, the little black
“piccaninnys,” and the interior of the house itself.
Mr. and Mrs. Gossett, Cousin Carolina’s niece and
nephew, were a gay young couple also of the party,
which included Cousin Carolina’s old schoolfellow,
Miss Virginia Boone, a lineal descendant of the
founder of the State. She was an interesting woman,
and had a fund of stories relating to Kentucky and the
Civil War, which rent the State in two. One day
Lucy asked her to tell us something about Rochelle
itself; it was so mellowed and solid, and in its way
delightful, with an atmosphere of age and peace.
Surely it had a history?</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” said Miss Boone, clearing her
throat, “Carolina has not lived here long—it’s not <i>her</i>
family place. It belonged to the Taylors a great while
back, and it was standing empty for quite a spell.
The grass is said to be the best in the world for young
horses, and Philip was crazy to come here, so he
routed his mother out at last; Rochelle was a dead
bargain too, and though Carolina was loath to move,
now she likes it.” Then, as if to herself, she added,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
“She comes from a distance—or maybe she’d never
have come at all!”</p>

<p>This was a dark saying, and I hastened to beg for
some enlightenment.</p>

<p>Miss Boone seemed to hesitate before she answered
rather vaguely, “Well, of course, all great plantations
are the same.”</p>

<p>“The same?” I echoed.</p>

<p>“Yes, where numbers of slaves have been
employed. See,” pointing to a row of lines or negro
quarters to the north of the house. “I expect in
Taylor’s time there were hundreds there. The
estates were some of the largest in Kentucky.”</p>

<p>“Cousin Carolina still has black servants,” I
remarked.</p>

<p>“Oh yes—Uncle Pete, Mammy, and Jane were
born in the family, the children of children, of slaves,
yet devoted to the Dormers.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, I saw such a forbidding looking
nigger staring in through the breakfast-room window?”
said Lucy. “I’ve never noticed him as one
of the servants or hands, and he looked anything but
devoted! He was coal black and big, and he pressed
his hideous face close up against the glass door and
scowled at me and muttered something; when I got up,
and went to find out what he wanted, he was gone.”</p>

<p>“A tramp,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Possibly. I hope I shan’t see him again!” said
Lucy, rising. “Here come the horses and the buggy;
you,” to me, “will have the house to yourself for the
whole afternoon.”</p>

<p>“So much the better,” I answered; “I intend to
make a sketch of Taffy, and there will be no one to
distract his attention.”</p>

<p>Taffy was a handsome fox-terrier, remarkable for a
very short tail and great independence of character.</p>

<p>I watched the cavalcade turn down the avenue,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Cousin Carolina and Miss Boone driving, followed by
two mounted couples, and then set to work to persuade
Taffy to sit for his portrait. By and by the fierce
glare of the setting sun compelled me to retreat with
my block, paint-box, and model into the north verandah.
This overlooked from a respectful distance the
servants’ quarters—and, possibly for this reason, was
but little frequented. It proved delightfully shady
and almost empty, save for a few roomy old cane
chairs, but now that I had obtained a satisfactory
light my sitter began to fail me; he became restless,
fidgety and disobedient, turning his head, pricking
up his ears; finally he trotted off bodily. His attitude
implied grave suspicion of something, or somebody—and
his air was so uneasy that he almost gave the
impression of there being an intruder in our vicinity—visible
only to him!</p>

<p>This of course was a ridiculous idea, but as nothing
would induce Taffy to “sit,” I relinquished the hope
of finishing my sketch, and fetching a book from the
drawing-room, settled myself comfortably in one of
the cane chairs and prepared to pass an hour of undisturbed
enjoyment. The story of “Uncle Tom”
proved to be absorbing; I had almost lost consciousness
of my surroundings, when I was startled by a
very peculiar sound quite close to me, a strange
inarticulate gurgling noise, as if someone was being
choked. I looked about; there was not a soul in the
verandah, and I came to the conclusion that Taffy had
swallowed a fly, which had gone the wrong way. I
called to him; he was not fly-catching, but seemed to
be staring intently at a certain closed door, and
entirely unconscious of my presence.</p>

<p>I resumed my book, only to be again disturbed by
this peculiar choking noise, and Taffy, with all his
hair bristling on his back, now sought refuge under
my chair, uttering low growls. At the same moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
I noticed, coming directly from the servants’ lines, a
gigantic negro, whom I never remembered to have
seen before. His head was bare, his face lowering
and sullen; he wore a ragged blue and white striped
jacket, trousers turned up to his knees, and a pair of
clumsy boots. As he advanced, with a deliberate,
purposeful air, I became conscious of a sensation of
fear, which increased with every stride.</p>

<p>The evening was still and warm, not a breath of air
was stirring, the very leaves were motionless. Taffy
was dumb, and the only sound to be heard was these
doggedly approaching footsteps.</p>

<p>A door in the verandah was suddenly flung open
and, to my amazement, there came forth a middle-aged
lady, who was a complete stranger; she wore a
flowing white dressing-gown, with wide sleeves; her
reddish hair, of which she had a quantity, hung
loosely to her waist, her figure was tall and slight, her
sallow face—this I only saw in profile—looked hard
as flint; the expression of her sharply-cut features was
fiercely determined, and aggressive. She hurried
across the verandah with light, pattering footsteps,
and reached the railings that enclosed it, almost at the
same moment as the huge black. I gathered that
she addressed him angrily—her face expressed violent
fury—but I could not distinguish a single word. I
sat there motionless, an amazed and nervous spectator.
Presently Taffy crawled out from under my chair, and
with one piercing howl fled from the scene like a
creature possessed.</p>

<p>I observed that the negro listened to his mistress
with downcast eyes, and an air of stolid indifference,
also that, as he waited, he held one hand against
his back; grasped in that hand—invisible to the
woman—was a shining blade about two feet long,
which I recognised as the knife used for cane-cutting,
and called a “machite.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>As the two figures stood, one on the verandah, the
other immediately beneath, I became aware that an
enormous crowd had assembled outside the quarters,
hundreds of coloured people—and a sudden hoarse
hum arose, resembling the buzzing of angry bees.
Finally the lady raised her clenched fist with a fierce,
threatening gesture, and turned away.</p>

<p>As she did so, the negro gave a deep guttural laugh,
reached out his arm, caught her violently by the hair,
and dragged her head backwards over the edge of the
railing. I saw her long thin throat, fully exposed,
and it was with a shock of unexampled horror that I
beheld the descent of a gleaming blade. With one
swift stroke the wretched woman’s head was severed
from her body, and I heard the previous gurgling and
choking sound, as it fell with a heavy thud upon the
lawn, while the trunk collapsed in a hideous heap
upon the boards of the verandah—which were
instantly deluged with blood. The dreadful tide was
flowing towards me, but I was unable to stir hand or
foot—I felt as if I were paralysed.</p>

<p>As the murderer, stooping, lifted the head by its
hair, I had a view of the blanched and ghastly face,
and the wide-open eyes fixed in wild astonishment.
He held it up towards the lines, and in response there
rose strange, fierce, and prolonged yells of jubilation—such,
I imagine, as are uttered by savages, when
exulting over some fallen enemy. Then with his
horrible trophy in one hand and a dripping knife in
the other, the negro turned, and looked straight at <i>me</i>.
Instantly everything became blurred, black darkness
descended, and I remember no more!</p>

<p>When I came to myself, the clear imperative voice
of Cousin Carolina was saying:</p>

<p>“My dear Marion, do you know that it is very
imprudent to sleep out of doors at sundown—even in
our exquisite climate?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“Sleep!” I repeated, with an involuntary shudder;
“I’ve not been sleeping,” and with a painful effort I
rose and tottered into a lighted sitting-room.</p>

<p>“What has happened to you, Marion?” cried my
sister; “you look simply awful. Are you ill?—or
have you seen a ghost?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered, looking round at six expectant
faces, “I have seen <i>two</i> in the verandah!”</p>

<p>I noticed that Miss Boone gave me a quick, sharp
look, but the rest of the company wore indulgent
smiles, and Cousin Carolina said:</p>

<p>“No such thing as ghosts, my dear—it’s only
ignorant people like the negroes that believe in them
<i>now</i>. You have Scotch blood in your veins, your
mother was a Highlander, and no doubt you are a bit
superstitious, and you have such imagination, dearest
child, and are so highly strung. You have just dozed
off and had a nightmare.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, what do you <i>think</i> you saw?” enquired
Philip, who had brought me a glass of wine.</p>

<p>I sipped this before I answered:</p>

<p>“A horrible sight, a lady in a white gown—I
believe the owner of the estate—was beheaded in the
verandah by a huge negro, and all the slaves—hundreds
of them—shouted, and yelled for joy.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gossett, who was young and giddy, began to
giggle, and then apologised, adding:</p>

<p>“It sounds so screamingly funny—a public execution
in the Rochelle verandah!”</p>

<p>“It was just a bad nightmare, the combined result
of crab salad at lunch, and ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin,’”
declared Cousin Carolina, “and nothing else. I
believe there is a place—somewhere near Lexington—that
<i>has</i> a story, but it is certainly not Rochelle, and
sensible folk don’t believe in such tales.”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered, now fortified by company and
port wine. “But you will admit that seeing is believing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
I’ve heard that my mother had second sight,
and I’m afraid she has bequeathed it to <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“My dear, you are a little upset,” said Cousin
Carolina; “don’t think of your dream, and you will
soon forget it. I daresay it was very vivid. I implore
you not to repeat it to any of the servants, or we shall
have the place in an uproar. Now just go and lie
down, and get a rest before supper-time; Lucy will
look after you. Another time, we won’t leave you to
keep house all alone.”</p>

<p>Cousin Carolina was a despotic lady in her way,
and would never suffer my nightmare in the back
north verandah to be discussed. I still stuck to my
opinion, but was as one to six—for even my own
sister had deserted me and preached about imagination,
and crab salad. It seemed impossible that a
mere nightmare could ever be so vivid in its horror,
and its realism. For several days I felt ill and
nervous, and it was only my pride, Cousin Carolina’s
forcible character, and Mrs. Gossett’s wild giggle, that
restrained me from removing myself to an hotel at
Lexington.</p>

<p>I never sat alone, and preferred a crowd to solitude.
I even thrust my company on Phil and Lucy, now an
engaged couple. Taffy and I were fast friends; we
two had shared a unique experience—an experience
apart. I was sensible of this bond in his manner,
and I read it in the expression of his wistful and
expressive eye.</p>

<p>A suspicion, nay, a conviction, took root in my
mind. Miss Boone knew more about Rochelle than
she pretended. More than once, I found her gazing
at me, with an air of peculiar interest, and, more than
once, curiosity had urged her to angle (very
cautiously) for some particulars of the tragedy I
thought I had seen; but I declined to indulge her.
She was an unbeliever—and I held my tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>In the month of January, Lucy once more faced the
Atlantic, accompanied by Miss Boone, Philip, and
myself. She was obliged to arrange about her trousseau,
and money affairs. We travelled by a big liner,
and had on the whole a capital trip. Miss Boone
found several friends among the passengers, and one
afternoon as we sat in the library in the idle hour
which follows tea, an old lady, her son and daughter
joined our small circle. We discussed a variety of
topics and impressions, and at last came to Kentucky
State, Lexington, and Rochelle.</p>

<p>“Rochelle,” repeated the lady’s daughter. “Is
not that the haunted house, Momma?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Taylors’ place,” she answered briskly;
“there is a dreadful story about it, but I fancy it is
more or less forgotten by this time. For years and
years it could not be let—the house, I mean; the land
of course is most valuable.”</p>

<p>“What is the story?” I enquired, and I glanced
with some significance at Lucy and Philip.</p>

<p>“I remember hearing of it from my mother,” continued
the old lady, “and it’s gospel truth. The
Taylors were wealthy, and had a great estate, and
hundreds of slaves, and were well thought of by all,
till the time of Mrs. Herman Taylor, a widow, who
inherited it from her husband. She was very strange—some
said crazy—and lived alone; hoarded her
money, flogged her slaves, and worked them to death.
There were stories of terrible scenes at Rochelle—that
lovely old place, so dignified and admired, had become
a sort of negroes’ hell! People could only talk—they
did not dare to interfere. Marcella Taylor was
a rich woman, and a vindictive enemy, and had overseers
as cruel and hard as herself, and she got more
out of her slaves in the way of return than any mistress
or master in the State. When it was moonlight, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
was said, she worked them all night, and her crops
were extraordinary.”</p>

<p>At last the situation became intolerable; beyond the
endurance of flesh and blood. A field hand who had
been cruelly flogged took the law into his own hands,
and one evening, in the sight of the entire community,
executed Mrs. Taylor in her own verandah! He had
been summoned to receive a punishment, and the story
is, that he suddenly drew a long knife, which he had
concealed, dragged her backwards by the hair, and
beheaded her on the spot. He took the head with
him, escaped to the woods, and was never seen or
heard of again.</p>

<p>“It was also said that every anniversary the scene
was re-enacted in the same verandah—but fortunately
was only visible to some. The Villiers, who succeeded
to the estates, hated the place, and got rid of it, and
so for two generations the house has had a bad name,
but now it is apparently recovering its character. I
suppose the supernatural has a time-limit?”</p>

<p>She glanced at me interrogatively, but Miss Boone
threw me an imploring look and I suffered silence to
pass for assent. In this extraordinary and unexpected
fashion my experience was confirmed, my truthfulness
vindicated, there was an end to gibes about dreams,
and crab salad. Subsequently Miss Boone confessed
to me that the tale of the north verandah was not new
to her, but that she had not wished to frighten Cousin
Carolina. As if anything could frighten Cousin Carolina!
She has nerves of cast-iron.</p>

<p>As for Lucy, she assured me with a rather unsteady
laugh that when, as Mrs. Philip Dormer, she returned
to Rochelle, nothing that could be offered would ever
induce her to spend an afternoon there <i>alone</i>.</p>

IMITATION PEARLS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was entirely owing to the death and defalcations
of a trustee that my sister Linda and I—heiresses in a
small way—awoke one morning to find ourselves
penniless! We were orphans, and since our schooldays
had made our home with a widowed aunt in the
depth of the country, on the borders of an ancient
village, within a parish whose extent was under a
hundred acres. Aunt Sophy’s house, which enjoyed
the flattering name of “Heart’s Delight,” was a little
old manor, with shallow oak stairs, low ceilings and
heavy beams, standing in the midst of rich meadows
and stately trees, and immediately surrounded by a
delicious garden, with mulberry trees, and a stew-pond.</p>

<p>Here we three lived in complete harmony. Aunt
Sophy was fifty-four, my sister Linda, temporary
housekeeper and manager, was twenty-four—she was
engaged to Arthur Fortescue, a naval officer on the
China station—whilst I was but twenty, rather pretty,
incorrigibly cheerful, and entirely fancy free.</p>

<p>Mr. Benford, our guardian, who had been father’s
best man—and was presumed to be our best friend—was
a bland, somewhat portly, elderly gentleman,
who, when we made rare visits to London, took us to
the theatre, and to dine at smart restaurants, and
even lent us his beautiful blue Panhard! He occupied
luxurious bachelor quarters in the West End, and was
generally supposed to be enviably rich. Recently he
died rather suddenly—indeed, suicide had been suspected—and
when his affairs came to be examined,
three tragic facts were disclosed. For years, he had
been involved in serious difficulties; his debts were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
enormous, and our twelve thousand pounds had long
been dispersed in wild speculations—though he had
paid us the interest punctually twice a year—and now
both our guardian and our income had ceased to exist.</p>

<p>At first we felt stunned; and for many days Aunt
Sophy remained sternly incredulous. Ultimately the
truth was brought home to her by friends. Letters
and visits of sympathy, offers of advice and help were
not lacking. Linda, who was really the head of the
house, promptly decided that one or both of us must
turn out and work for our living, for Aunt Sophy’s
means were limited (barely two hundred a year,
besides “Heart’s Delight” and its contents).</p>

<p>The first and most essential move was to cut down
expenses; the victoria and dogcart, the sleek horse,
and sleeker cows, were sold, maids and gardener dismissed,
and the establishment reduced to a mere
general and boy. The old pony remained to take
aunt out in the governess-car, but the meadows were
let, and the family silver disposed of, as well as two
much-prized Chippendale chairs.</p>

<p>Arthur Fortescue’s uncle, a wealthy admiral on the
retired list (who invariably spoke of himself as a “sea-dog”),
would not consent to Linda taking any situation—indeed,
he was furious at the mere suggestion—but
offered no alternative. However, a girl so
capable and contriving was in the right place at home;
she proposed a daring scheme—to make the garden
<i>pay</i>, and also to undertake delicate needlework for one
of the great outfitting shops in London.</p>

<p>Summer wore into autumn, yet still I, so to speak,
“remained on hand.” I gardened, and sewed industriously,
and did housework, hoping every day that
Aunt Sophy’s anxious wish might be fulfilled, and
that “something nice would turn up for Letty.” A
post as companion to an amiable and wealthy old
lady; or as governess to two dear little girls under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
ten, was what my friends desired. I spoke French
fluently, and was a good pianist, but as so much more
is expected in these days (Latin, German, Euclid,
Mathematics, Gymnastics, Sketching), the value of
my services was placed at the low figure of forty
pounds per annum and washing; and yet in spite of
this moderate assessment, no eager employer had
claimed me!</p>

<p>The truth was, we were out of the beaten track—and
Early Victorian in our ideas. Aunt Sophy had a
horror of “seeing me in an advertisement,” as she
expressed it. “It was always so much pleasanter
and safer to try and hear of a nice opening through
one’s friends.”</p>

<p>And to do them justice, our friends were active—especially
Miss Pinfold—an old maid who lived at the
other end of the village; Mrs. Clarke, our rector’s wife,
was also zealous on my behalf. Miss Pinfold wrote
many letters, also scores of postcards, and almost
every acquaintance had been victimised and pestered,
irrespective of age or sex. More than once she said
to Aunt Sophy:</p>

<p>“If Letty could only go to <i>India</i>! I’ll lay my life
a girl with her remarkable looks will marry some
wonderful catch.”</p>

<p>But Aunt Sophy was not in favour of this dazzling
idea and looked coldly on the scheme. India was too
far away, and was said to be the happy hunting-ground
of fast women—as well as abounding with
snakes!</p>

<p>For my own part, I had always (privately) cherished
a burning desire to see the East, and though I did not
believe in the wonderful, or any, “catch,” I was profoundly
interested in Miss Pinfold’s tales of the days
of her grandfather, who had been a famous Indian
warrior, and had fought the Sikhs, and also in the
more modern activities of her two married nieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>In the end, it was Mrs. Clarke who brought us the
great news! She arrived one evening at tea-time,
eager and important, letter in hand, and breathlessly
announced that she had found “the very thing for
Letty at last!” Her husband’s cousin, who received
Indian children, and had “an Indian connection,”
knew of a lady, the wife of an official in good position,
who required a governess to take charge of two dear
little girls, aged seven and eight; they were in the
hills almost all the year in a perfect climate; the salary
offered was forty pounds and a second-class passage
out, and, if suitable, an engagement for two years.
The governess must be a gentlewoman, young,
healthy, energetic, and Church of England. She
would be required to teach French, English, and
music, and expected to arrive not later than the end
of February. It was now November.</p>

<p>“It seems made for Letty!” said Mrs. Clarke—her
voice quivering with triumph as she handed the
epistle to my aunt; “you should write <i>at once</i>!”</p>

<p>But Aunt Sophy and Linda were politely dubious.</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Clarke, who <i>is</i> this Mrs. Hooper?”
enquired my sister. “Letty could not write and
engage herself to a lady we know nothing about; of
course, there must be mutual references; and forty
pounds for India is <i>so</i> little!”</p>

<p>“Well, she gets her board and washing free,” put
in Miss Pinfold, who happened to be present, “and
has the forty pounds in her pocket, and, as I’ve said
before, Letty will never come home Letty Harlowe—she’ll
make a great match!” and she rubbed her
knees with an air of complacent finality.</p>

<p>“Not likely,” objected Linda; “and Letty is not
going to India on the chance of finding a husband.
Arthur says those days were over sixty years ago. Of
course, I know Letty has always devoured books on
India, and longs to see it; but she is not to jump at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Mrs. Hooper’s offer—though it is so good of Mrs.
Clarke to bring it and, I know she,” looking at her,
“would be the first to advise caution.”</p>

<p>Ultimately Mrs. Hooper proved to be my fate. Her
references were unexceptional. Colonel Hooper was
in the Indian Army, and held an important post on
“the Survey.” She wrote Aunt Sophy a letter that
was almost gushing, and promised to take every care
of the dear girl and treat her, in short, as the
daughter of the house! I may mention that my
references had been forwarded, and included a warm
recommendation from a lady of title.</p>

<p>The next weeks simply flew! My outfit was put
in hand, an escort was found for me in Mrs. Russell,
a distant relative, whose husband commanded a regiment
in Bengal, and our passages were booked in the
<i>Malwa</i>, which sailed on February 5th. Linda had
insisted that I should travel first-class, and share Mrs.
Russell’s cabin. She had known our mother, and
was sure to be kind to me. The extra passage money
and my outfit made a deep hole in our finances, and
Linda sold almost the whole of our jewellery in order
to meet these expenses. All my ornaments now consisted
of a pair of gold bangles, a watch, and a string
of Parisian pearls, fastened by an old diamond clasp
that had belonged to my grandmother.</p>

<p>I will draw a veil over those last weeks at home,
my tearful farewells to the neighbours, Aunt Sophy,
and the dogs. Linda and I spent our last day together in
London, and the next morning she escorted me down
to Tilbury in order to see me off. The <i>Malwa</i> seemed
to be a full ship; there were numbers of passengers
bound for Gibraltar and Egypt. In the saloon a wire
was awaiting me; it was from Mrs. Russell, and said,
“My boy dangerously ill, appendicitis, departure
postponed, sorry.” Undoubtedly I was condemned
to travel alone, and must just make the best of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
situation. Linda was most dreadfully concerned.
She actually broke down, and wept.</p>

<p>“I felt so confident, and happy at your having <i>one</i>
friend in India,” she sobbed. “Oh, it’s really heart-breaking!”</p>

<p>After I had comforted her a little, we descended
together in order to inspect my cabin and arrange my
belongings. We found Mrs. Russell’s place already
occupied—evidently by a lady who used a prodigious
amount of scent. She had secured the bottom berth,
the best looking-glass, and her odds and ends were
scattered about in a most disorderly fashion.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when Linda and I walked about
together, she said:</p>

<p>“How I hate your going alone, Letty; you are so
young—yes, and so pretty. How I wish there was
some nice, motherly woman I could pin you on to!”
and she looked around the crowd with a face of blank
despair. “Do be careful who you speak to, and who
you get to know; keep to yourself as much as possible,
and above all avoid men.”</p>

<p>Never had I seen Linda so depressed, so nervous or
so tearful—not even when Arthur went to China—and
I must confess that I, too, wept bitterly as I signalled
to a figure that waved from the dock.</p>

<p>Going down the Channel the weather was moderate.
I found my allotted place at dinner, and kept it, too.
There were about twelve at our table. On my left
was a florid young officer, with prominent brown eyes
and turned-up moustache, who talked to me persistently;
but after that evening I spent two miserable
days in my berth. My cabin companion proved to
be a stout, showy lady, with auburn hair, expressive
dark eyes, and an exquisite complexion. She seemed
to fill the whole cabin, and to be under the impression
that she was its sole occupant.</p>

<p>At an early hour the stewardess brought her a stiff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
whisky and soda, afterwards, she smoked cigarettes,
breakfasted on grilled duck and porter, and then made
a leisurely and elaborate toilette—sitting before the
glass on a rickety camp stool doing up her face with
various little brushes and pencils, serenely indifferent
to my interested inspection. Her hair, which seemed
coarse and rather scanty, was supplemented by a
generous supply of curls and rolls; her petticoats were
the most elaborate I ever beheld, and her dress,
blouse, and furs looked equally expensive. She wore
enormous diamond earrings, a jaunty, rather <i lang="fr">outré</i>
hat, and eventually sallied forth in obvious good
humour with her own appearance.</p>

<p>All the afternoon she sprawled in her berth,
smoking, dozing, and drinking whiskies and soda.
Subsequently she attired herself for dinner in a
costume that was far more suitable to a ballroom than
board ship. The lady kept late hours, snored noisily,
and never vouchsafed the faintest recognition of me,
until I brusquely introduced myself to her notice. I
was watching her toilette on the third morning out,
with almost painful intensity. I had read of the “art
of making up the face,” and now I was receiving first-rate,
first-hand, instruction. As the artist was about
to put away her brushes I could not refrain from
exclaiming:</p>

<p>“You’ve forgotten the left eyebrow!”</p>

<p>“Laws, so I ’ave!” she answered with astonishing
composure. “And so you are not dumb or dead,
you little cherub up aloft? My! but you ’ave ’ad a
time! You look like a happorth of soap after a week’s
washing. Take my advice and ’ave a good old whisky
and soda, and <i>that</i> will buck you up.”</p>

<p>Although I turned a deaf ear to this suggestion, I
managed to dress, and with the assistance of the
stewardess crawled on deck the same afternoon. It
was bitterly cold and sunless, and I realised that I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
all alone aboard this great rolling steamer, on the grey
heaving sea, amidst a crowd of total strangers. No
doubt I looked rather shaky and forlorn, for a nice old
gentleman, with a friendly face, came forward and led
me to a chair, whilst another—a younger man—placed
a rug over my knees.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you are up,” said the former.
“Anything is better than stifling down below, eh?”</p>

<p>I smiled faintly as I thanked him.</p>

<p>“I suppose your friends are <i lang="fr">hors de combat</i>?” he
continued, as he sat down beside me.</p>

<p>“My friends—I have none on board. I am all
alone,” I replied. I still felt weak and giddy, and
could not restrain the tears which started into my eyes.</p>

<p>“You must allow me to bring you some chicken
broth,” urged the younger gentleman, who had a
clear-cut, clean-shaven face, and wore a fur-lined coat;
and in another moment a steaming cup was in my
hands. As I sipped the broth I felt revived, the keen
sea air refreshed me, and sitting between my two new
acquaintances I found myself telling them that I was
going all the way to Bombay, that it was my first long
journey, and how I had been disappointed of the company
of my chaperone.</p>

<p>“I hope you have a nice cabin companion?”
enquired the old man (I believe he was about fifty).</p>

<p>I hesitated for a moment, and then indicated my
partner, who, at a little distance, lay extended in a
chair bandying good stories and chaff with a hearty
audience of three men. It seemed to me that my
neighbours exchanged hasty glances, and instantly
began to talk about some of the other passengers.
Many, I gathered, were still below; we had a prince
and princess and suite on board, a well-known
novelist, a famous actress, but all the notable and
wealthy passengers were landing at Port Said for
Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“After the Canal,” added my new acquaintance,
“we shall be an empty ship.”</p>

<p>At dinner time the weather was calmer, and I
ventured to descend, and found myself once more
beside the agreeable officer, who welcomed me with
effusion. During the courses he told me the names
of most of those at our table. My old gentleman was,
it seemed, a General Pontifex, who was <i lang="fr">en route</i> for
Madras, to take up a command; his clean-shaven,
good-looking companion was his nephew, a Mr.
Sandars, bound for the jungle and sport. Captain
Bilton (my neighbour) informed me that he was only
going to Gib., but that as far as he went he would
consider me his special charge, and proved as good
as his word. He sat beside me on deck, and subsequently
promenaded with me, and, although I
assumed my most distant manner (remembering
Linda’s warning), became every hour more and more
friendly and confidential. On the fourth evening,
he suddenly remarked:</p>

<p>“I say, Miss Harlowe, what a ripping necklace you
have! I wonder you dare to wear it on board ship.”</p>

<p>I made no reply, and turned the subject; but when
he again returned to the charge, and said as he stared
fixedly at my ornament, “Do excuse my rudeness, but
I must confess one does not often see such topping
pearls!” I felt that I must not allow him to deceive
himself, and replied:</p>

<p>“I am glad you admire them—but they are not
real.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” he protested energetically, “I
think I know real pearls when I see them.”</p>

<p>“I assure you that I bought these in Regent Street
for twenty-five shillings.”</p>

<p>“What! Well, I never was more deceived in my
life—such colour and shape; they look worth every
penny of five thousand pounds!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“I only wish they were,” I answered unguardedly.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I would not then be on my way to India.”</p>

<p>“But you are going out to your people, and are
just the sort of girl that will have a ripping time!”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you are wrong again—real pearls and
ripping times are not for me! I am on my way to be
a governess in Naini Tal.”</p>

<p>For a moment he was too stupefied to speak, his
eyes seemed to travel over me from my necklace, my
lace blouse (remnant of better days) to my neat evening
shoes, and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“By Jove! You don’t say so! Anyone would
take you for the daughter of a millionaire.”</p>

<p>After this evening I seemed no longer to have any
special interest for Captain Bilton; he scarcely spoke
to me at meals, and then in an off-hand, patronising
manner, that I secretly resented; yet on deck, the
night of our last conversation, he had assured me he
had never in all his life been so much struck by a girl
as by me, and we must not lose sight of one another.
He added that he would write—and send me a fan
from Gib.</p>

<p>How thankful I was that I had received this overture
with civil discouragement, for when we touched
Gibraltar, Captain Bilton had so far forgotten my
existence as not even to wish me good-bye!</p>

<p>The Mediterranean was warmer than the Bay, and
I was nearly suffocated by the perfumes in my cabin,
for my companion (Madame Garda) would not suffer
the ports to be opened; and really between patchouli
and cigarette smoke, I felt all but asphyxiated. Two
days before we reached Port Said I missed the string
of pearls—my sole and paltry ornament: I remembered
that I had worn it the previous night, and taken
it off when I undressed; and now it was gone. I
searched very carefully. No, there was not a trace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
of it. I applied to Madame Garda when she swung
into the cabin before tea.</p>

<p>“Pearls! Never knew you had such things! We
must have a good look. Imitation, you say? Well,
even so, you don’t want to lose them, do you?” and
she good-naturedly went down on her knees, and
raked under the berth with an umbrella, searched all
over the floor with her large bejewelled hands—and
found nothing!</p>

<p>“It’s a pity!” she exclaimed, rising breathless.
“I do ’ate losing things myself. Maybe you dropped
’em on deck—them clasps are so rotten.”</p>

<p>The next day I confided my loss to the stewardess,
who came into the cabin and instituted a most business-like
investigation.</p>

<p>“If you say you had them, and hung them on your
pin-cushion night afore last, they’re bound to be in
this cabin, and I’m bound to find them!” she
announced with an air of invincible determination.
After examining all my property, she proceeded to
turn out madame’s belongings with reckless disrespect,
violently shaking her gowns and petticoats.</p>

<p>“Ah! ha!” she exclaimed, as suddenly, with a
clinking sound, my necklace fell out of the pocket of
a gorgeous bath-gown. “I thought as much!” and
she nodded at me with terrible significance; “now
you lock them up, miss.”</p>

<p>“But, stewardess, they are only imitation,” I protested,
“and it must have been a mistake.”</p>

<p>“I don’t hold with those sort of mistakes,” she
sternly declared. “Your pretty sister asked me to
keep an eye on you, and so I have. To-morrow
madame goes ashore, and a good riddance. Her
liquor bill would frighten a barman, and after to-morrow,
Miss Harlowe, you will have the cabin to
yourself.”</p>

<p>I do not know if madame discovered that her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
dressing-gown had been rifled; at any rate, she made
no sign, and before she landed bade me an affectionate
farewell, assuring me that “I was a real good, decent
little girl—and she could go round the world with
me!”</p>

<p>The important Egyptian crowd went ashore with
piles of luggage, maids, and valets, bent on a season
in Cairo, or a trip to Assouan, or even Khartoum.
The remnant left was comparatively a small number;
officers and officials and planters going East, at the
end of their leave, to brave the horrors of approaching
hot weather. An Eastern moon lighted us down the
Red Sea, and we had the piano and music on deck.
I played most of the accompaniments, and always
those for Mr. Sandars, who had a beautiful tenor
voice and sang some of Wagner’s songs—especially
the prize song from the Meistersinger—delightfully.
By this time I had become well acquainted with him
and his uncle; indeed, they seemed like old friends,
particularly the uncle, who had a knack of absorbing
my confidences. I told him all about home, Linda
and her <i lang="fr">fiancé</i> (General Pontifex, it turned out, had
been fag to the Admiral, and invariably burnt his
toast and boots) and our losses. I described our neighbours,
our dogs, and even Methusalem, the aged but
active pony. In the mornings I played deck quoits
with Mr. Sandars as partner, and in the evenings after
dinner paced up and down the deck with the General,
his uncle.</p>

<p>Besides these, I had made the acquaintance of two
ladies—Mrs. Wallace and Mrs. Mason—wives of
officials in Madras, who also sat at our table, and were
charming to me. Oh, how I dreaded the end of the
trip, when I should lose my new friends, and be once
more a castaway amongst total strangers.</p>

<p>The evening before we landed, General Pontifex
begged me to give him my address, and also not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
think it a liberty if he ventured to advise me in one
matter. This, I was amazed to learn, was a request
not to wear my beautiful pearls every day, and in all
companies.</p>

<p>“India,” he declared, “is a land where jewels are
more highly prized than elsewhere—and yours are
magnificent, Miss Harlowe; they invite envy, and
tempt thieves.”</p>

<p>“But they are imitation,” I replied impatiently—I
was becoming tired of making this announcement.
“I bought them in Regent Street two years ago. My
sister thought they were too large and remarkable, but
I would have them; they cost twenty-five shillings,
and the clasp alone is real.”</p>

<p>“They look immensely valuable,” he rejoined.
“Many people have noticed them—they have the real
sheen. You are <i>sure</i> they are imitation?”</p>

<p>“Positive,” I answered; “if they were real we
would have sold them with the rest of our jewellery,
and the old silver and ‘chairs.’”</p>

<p>Mr. Sandars, who happened to be standing by, overheard
this conversation. He also heard Mrs. Mason
and Mrs. Wallace requesting me to write and let them
know how I was getting on.</p>

<p>“I, too, should like to hear,” he said, “but I am
going into the jungle, and don’t know my own
address; but when I do emerge—I hope I may have
tidings of you—somehow——”</p>

<p>There was something so significant in his glance
that I felt my heart throb, and my face suddenly
flame. I realised acutely how honestly glad I should
be to have tidings of Mr. Sandars. But my prudent
sister, with second-hand wisdom, had warned me
against certain snares.</p>

<p>“Arthur says that no matter what warm friendships
or desperate love affairs are started on ship-board, they
<i>all</i> come to nothing! There is no one so soon forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
as a fellow-passenger—he or she goes clean out
of your mind along with all the voyage miseries.”</p>

<p>To my surprise I did not part with the General and
Mr. Sandars on the Apollo Bund in Bombay; we
travelled in the same train (but not in the same
carriage), crawling up and down the towering Ghâts,
and onwards across the level, monotonous plains.
They visited me from time to time with offerings of
books or fruit, until early one morning we arrived at
Basaule Junction, where they joined a mail for the
South.</p>

<p>Here, after the General had said good-bye, Mr.
Sandars returned unexpectedly and, holding my hand
for a second, looked at me steadily. I noticed that his
lips were trembling, as they said, “Little girl, don’t
forget me?” then he turned abruptly, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Early as it was, the first of March, Mrs. Hooper was
already installed at “Beverley,” a large, imposing
house overlooking the lake at Naini Tal, and almost
directly under Cheena. She received me in the
drawing-room—which gave one the immediate impression
of a great deal of pink. Everything seemed
to be of this colour—the covers, curtains, carpet, lampshades.
Mrs. Hooper was a woman of five-and-thirty,
tall, dark, and very handsome, with an alarmingly
deep voice. She accorded me—considering my
long journey, and the fact that I was to be “the
daughter of the house”—a surprisingly cool reception.
I did not expect her to kiss me, but after my
recent fatiguing experience in a hill “dandy,” I
should have been glad if she had asked me to take off
my hat and have a cup of tea.</p>

<p>“Dear me, Miss Harlowe,” she exclaimed, “you
look much younger than I anticipated—why, you are
a mere child!” she added severely.</p>

<p>“I was twenty-one in February,” I replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“You might be seventeen! I hope I shall find you
competent, healthy, and above all <i>steady</i>,” surveying
me with a hard, concentrated stare.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” I assented stiffly.</p>

<p>Then she made searching enquiries respecting the
tiresome, cumbersome parcels I had brought out for
her, and, when her mind had been thoroughly
relieved, she raised her voice and called out “Teesie
and Dodo!” and two little girls, who must have been
within earshot, entered demurely; little girls with
sallow faces, bright black eyes, very scanty white
frocks, very thin black legs, and equally thin black
pigtails—tied, needless to say, with pink ribbon.</p>

<p>“These are your charges,” she explained. “Dodo
and Teesie, this is your new governess.”</p>

<p>The couple surveyed me in silence. Their expressions
reminded me of our dog, Tack, when he had
killed and buried a chicken—fearful, yet defiant!—and
presently my two pupils began to mutually criticise
me in voluble Hindustani, with gesticulations to
correspond.</p>

<p>Before very long I found my level in the household.
My quarters were at the back of the house—two
gloomy rooms looking straight into rocks on the hillside,
and when on wet days the rain streamed down,
the prospect was excessively depressing.</p>

<p>Here I endeavoured to teach the children, and here
we had our meals. We breakfasted together, afterwards
there were lessons and a promenade along the
upper Mall, tiffin in the dining-room with Colonel
and Mrs. Hooper—unless there was company; then
more lessons and another walk, supper, and to bed.
Our outings were restricted to the wooded hillsides
of two upper Malls; from whence we caught occasional
glimpses of the gleaming “Tal” a thousand feet
beneath us; we were never permitted to descend and
mix with the gay and giddy crowd who were playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
tennis or polo, boating, shopping, or riding. I found
that I was expected not only to teach the little girls,
mend their clothes and be their ever-constant companion,
but to wash the peevish Maltese dog, and,
when there was company, was pressed into service to
trim lamps, and arrange flowers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hooper, a “society woman,” was extremely
smart, popular, and rarely at home; and Colonel
Hooper, a stout, bald, good-natured man, was frequently
absent for many weeks on survey. The
children had been disgracefully neglected, and left
entirely to the Ayah and servants (with brief interludes
of governesses), and were appallingly wise for their
years.</p>

<p>“Mamma slapped Miss Vincent,” announced
Teesie, “and so she left. She made a bobbery, too,
and complained to the Padre. Miss Dodd would not
stay either; she was always crying, and said she was
a lady, and would not wash Motee, or do the dhoby—and
went away in a week.”</p>

<p>Vainly did I implore Teesie not to repeat things,
but she only cracked her fingers, native fashion, and
shouted at the top of her shrill voice, “Daddy says
you are awfully pretty—the prettiest girl in Naini—and
have a very poor time, and he and mammy had a
row—and mammy said she hated the sight of you!”</p>

<p>It was an undeniable fact that when the Colonel was
at home I was better off. He treated me with every
courtesy, sent me the <i>Pioneer</i>, twice escorted me to a
gymkhana with the children, and once to a theatrical
performance.</p>

<p>By the end of July I had been five months in India
and seen but little of the country, beyond the woody
walks in the upper Mall at Naini Tal—now wet as
sponges in the heavy monsoon—and “St. John in the
Wilderness” on Sunday evenings. Mrs. Hooper
attended in the morning, accompanied by the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
girls, who sat on either side of her with roving, knowing
eyes, but otherwise conducting themselves with
surprising discretion. This was the only time their
mother desired their society—she liked to pose (in
public) as a devoted parent. I was by no means the
daughter of the house, as Aunt Sophy fondly
believed; in fact, I was more like a maid-of-all-work,
but I kept my troubles to myself, for I knew that it
would make Linda and auntie miserable if I complained,
and I hoped at the end of a year to find some
loophole of escape—and go down to Madras, where
Mrs. Mason had invited me to pay her a long, long
visit in the Shevaroy Hills.</p>

<p>During these months I had learned Hindustani, had
gained the children’s entire approbation, received
some startling confidences, and experienced an adventure.
I was awakened one night by stealthy steps on
the matting in my room, and by the light of an oil
wick in a tumbler in the bathroom I beheld a tall, half-naked
native busily opening boxes and drawers on my
dressing table. I sat up and watched him for some
minutes—somehow I was not frightened—I knew the
chokedar and a peon were close by in the back
verandah. He seemed to be eagerly searching for
something; at last he drew it out, and it proved to be
the string of pearls! These he held up to the light,
felt them carefully, put them to his lips, licked them,
and was about to steal away, when suddenly I gave a
piercing shriek. He started violently, and dashed
into the bathroom.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my screams had been heard, and the
house was aroused. The thief endeavoured to escape
through the bathroom window, but it is quite one
thing to climb through a small space at your ease and
leisure, and another to be compelled to do so in a
desperate hurry. After a frantic struggle he wriggled
through, and in doing so dropped his prize—the string<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
of pearls fell out of his turban—but he fled away into
the woods below Cheena scot free.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Hooper heard of the thief’s visit she was
terribly alarmed, and a second watchman was immediately
stationed on guard in the verandah.</p>

<p>“I expect he was after my diamonds,” she declared,
“and these Budmashes are so expert, and so cunning—they
always slip off; their bodies are covered with
oil.”</p>

<p>It seemed so strange that there had been two
attempts to steal a miserable little string of false
pearls, and I now kept them locked up in my large
steamer trunk, and rarely wore them.</p>

<p>They had immediately attracted Mrs. Hooper’s
attention, and she, like others, listened to the usual
explanation, merely remarking:</p>

<p>“I wonder you bought them such a size! To my
mind it makes an imitation look <i>so</i> vulgar!”</p>

<p>Sometimes when ladies had tiffin at Beverley the
children and I were present, but on these occasions
Dodo and Teesie were temporarily suppressed, and I
was dumb and self-effaced.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sandars called to-day,” remarked Mrs.
Hooper to her visitor, Mrs. Leith; her tone indicated
triumph. “Such a nice, good-looking young fellow!
He has been shooting in the C.P. He is very well
connected, and unmarried.”</p>

<p>“What a chance for some of our spins!” said Mrs.
Leith.</p>

<p>“Oh, he doesn’t encourage girls—he is not a
marrying man.”</p>

<p>“Look at Miss Harlowe—isn’t she funny and
red!” cried Teesie, directing everyone’s attention to
me.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Miss Harlowe knows Mr. Sandars?”
said Mrs. Hooper, staring at me; her voice had a
sharp edge, and her eyes were piercing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“We came out in the same ship,” I explained.</p>

<p>“Oh, was that all?” and, turning once more to
her visitor, they began to discuss a great ball that
was to take place at the club, and soon forgot my
existence.</p>

<p>That same afternoon, as I was exercising the
children and the dogs in the middle Mall, I found
myself suddenly confronted by Mr. Sandars. He
looked uncommonly smart in his well-cut flannels, and
hailed me with an air of joyous rediscovery. After a
brief salutation, he said:</p>

<p>“So these are your charges. How are you getting
on?”</p>

<p>“Very well, thank you.”</p>

<p>“I must say you don’t do much credit to Naini Tal
air. You don’t look yourself—or happy.”</p>

<p>“You must not judge by appearances,” I answered
gaily. “Remember the pearls.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I remember the pearls—rather! I suppose
you have them still?”</p>

<p>I nodded and asked, “How is General Pontifex?”</p>

<p>“Very fit.”</p>

<p>“Did you have good sport?”</p>

<p>“Splendid. I have stacks of heads, horns, and
skins at Jubbulpore waiting for me to take them
home.”</p>

<p>“You will be going soon?”</p>

<p>“That depends. I called to-day on Mrs. Hooper,
and rather hoped to see you. I suppose you were
out?”</p>

<p>“No, she wasn’t,” broke in Teesie, who had been
an attentive listener, “she was giving me a music
lesson. Mamma never lets the governesses see company.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Teesie,” I expostulated, and Teesie turned
to her sister, and they gabbled together and held a
violent argument in what was really their native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
tongue. “I’m afraid we must be going home,” I
said. “I cannot keep these children out when the
mist rises from the lake.”</p>

<p>“May I walk back with you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, no, he may not,” declared Teesie with dignified
decision. “A young police officer used to come
and walk with Miss Shaw, and I told mummy, and
Miss Shaw was sent away directly!” and she cracked
her finger joints till they sounded like so many
squibs.</p>

<p>“And I don’t wish to be sent away,” I said with a
smile, as I offered him my hand.</p>

<p>“Well, I wonder at that!” he exclaimed, “but,
of course, it would be heart-breaking to part with that
delightful child. <i lang="fr">Au revoir!</i>” raising his cap; and
as we passed down the hill, I felt unaccountably uplifted
and consoled.</p>

<p>I noticed Mr. Sandars at evening church on Sunday,
and he walked home with me, as if it were entirely
a matter of course.</p>

<p>“I have friends who live here,” he said, “the
Osbornes, and they have told me all about the life
you lead with the smart Mrs. Hooper—<i lang="fr">joie de rue,
douleur de maison</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t listen to Naini Tal gossip!” I
protested.</p>

<p>“Then please listen to me. You know this ball
that comes off on Monday? My friends are going—Mrs.
Osborne has met you at tiffin, and she desires
me to say she will be delighted to take you.”</p>

<p>“It is most kind of her—but Colonel Hooper——”</p>

<p>“Will make no objection. I’ve squared <i>him</i>—he
knows my people at home, and he agrees that it is
time you had some little distraction.”</p>

<p>“I am sure Mrs. Hooper won’t like it—and I know
no one——”</p>

<p>“So much the better,” he interrupted, “then you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
can dance all the time with me. I suppose you have
a dress?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ll wear the pearl necklace. I’ve not
been to a dance for a year; it seems too good to be
true!”</p>

<p>After all, it was Mrs. Hooper who chaperoned me
to the dance (much against the grain), and good-natured
Colonel Hooper who introduced me to
partners. I spent a delightful evening, my card was
filled in five minutes, and I could have danced every
dance three times. I gave four waltzes to Mr.
Sandars, and, for once, tasted the pleasures of a social
success! In fact, I overhead whispers of, “What a
pretty girl! Who is she?” and the invariable
answer was, “<i>Mrs. Hooper’s governess</i>.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Hooper was not pleased with her
governess. Indeed the following morning she informed
me that I had made myself too shockingly conspicuous,
and was altogether such <i>bad</i> style; and
kindly Teesie threw oil upon the flames, for a little
later Mrs. Hooper, looking white and austere, came
to me, and said in her most impressive manner, and
in her deepest tone:</p>

<p>“Miss Harlowe, is it <i>true</i> that you have met Mr.
Sandars in the upper Mall, and that he said you did
not look happy—and asked you about the pearls?”</p>

<p>“He said I did not look <i>well</i>,” I corrected, “and
as to the pearls, that was merely an old joke.”</p>

<p>“Bring them to me at once!” she commanded
authoritatively. I brought them obediently, and
placed them in her hands. “They were remarked on
last night,” she announced, “someone said the Viceroy’s
wife had no better! Yes,” turning them over
as she spoke, “they <i>are</i> real,” and her voice vibrated
with indignation, “real; splendid, and worth
thousands! How can a governess on forty pounds a
year afford such? But that is easily—too easily—explained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
Mr. Sandars is the explanation—he gave
them to you, of course! He was your partner most
of last evening—it’s simply disgraceful! Now look
here,” breathing hard, “I give you three days’
notice, a month’s salary, and you get out of my
house!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hooper absolutely refused to listen to <i>any</i> explanation.
She would not allow me to speak. Crimson
in the face, and hoarse with passion, she reiterated:</p>

<p>“You assured me that they were imitation! I
know better now! It is <i>you</i> who are the imitation—the
imitation of a decent, respectable young woman.
I believe your references were forged!”</p>

<p>Luckily the children were at a party, not listening
(as usual) at the other side of the portière, and I had
the whole afternoon to myself. I wrote home, and
also to Mrs. Mason, and carried my letters down to
the post-office, as I intended to dispatch a wire. On
the hill I came face to face with Mr. Sandars.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” he exclaimed, as he paused and surveyed
me, “so you have been crying!”</p>

<p>I informed him that I had just been summarily
dismissed, and all because Mrs. Hooper believed that
I had not come honestly by the pearls. I also proceeded
to tell him how nearly they had been stolen
on two occasions, although they were worthless—and
that there was certainly something peculiar about
them—at any rate, they had brought me bad luck.</p>

<p>“It is extraordinary,” he assented, “and I cannot
make it out! The pearls look magnificent. I
noticed them last night; and yet you bought them
yourself, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and my sister was with me. I know the
very shop in Regent Street.”</p>

<p>“Ah well, never mind the pearls <i>now</i>!” he exclaimed
with an air of almost fierce determination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“No, and I shall certainly not wear them in my
next situation,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Your next situation?” he repeated.</p>

<p>“I think Mrs. Mason knows of one that will suit
me.”</p>

<p>“If it comes to that—so do <i>I</i>.”</p>

<p>I stared at him in amazement. Then, with a
gesture of impatience, he resumed, “Look here, I
can’t talk to you here among this buzzing crowd”
(we were now close to the landing-stage); “come out
on the lake with me for ten minutes. Never mind
Mrs. Hooper or Mrs. Grundy.”</p>

<p>When he had rowed some distance in dead silence,
he suddenly rested on his oars and confronted me
with a serious face.</p>

<p>“Miss Harlowe,” he said, “I’ve brought you out
here, where you cannot escape, to ask you to marry
me. Yes, no wonder you start—but listen. Ever
since I first saw you, from the moment you sat down
at table opposite to me looking so timid and white,
I’ve been in love with you. My uncle knew all about
it; he, too, experienced your charm, but he urged me
to go slow—you were so young and so inexperienced.
He improved your acquaintance in those long board-ship
walks and talks, and made me furiously jealous;
and as to that Bilton fellow, who started such running
at first, I felt inclined to pick a quarrel and pitch him
overboard. Perhaps you don’t know that I am
ridiculously rich; I wish I wasn’t; it sounds a funny
thing to say, but money is an immense responsibility,
and Uncle Tom said I was bound to marry a girl who
had a head on her shoulders, who could hold her
own in society and be a help—and that you were a
mere inexperienced child. However, he soon altered
that opinion. He found you modest, accomplished,
dignified and sensible. The next objection was far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
more serious. He declared that you did not care a
brass button about <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>It was not for me to enlighten him, and after a
pause he gravely continued:</p>

<p>“You never seemed to mind which of us you
talked to—indeed, of the two, you were far more confidential
and friendly with the General, and never
gave <i>me</i> any encouragement. However, I just ran
up here to see you. I have had your face before me
all the time I’ve been away shooting, and I seem to
have arrived at what they call the psychological
moment—when your affairs have come to a crisis; and
the upshot of this long story is—will you marry me?”</p>

<p>Subsequently we spent an exciting quarter of an
hour explaining, arguing, urging, and protesting,
for somehow though I felt desperately agitated, and
most unspeakably happy, I was frightened by his
money and the responsibilities of my future
‘position.’ However, as might be supposed, it ended
in my landing at the boat-house the <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> of Alaric
Sandars, and it was promptly arranged by my future
lord and master that I was to go straight to the
Osbornes as soon as I had put some things together,
and there make my preparations for an immediate
departure to England.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Now that we have despatched our wires, letters,
secured passages, and done no end of fagging things—including
my interview with Mrs. Hooper—let us
discuss the great pearl mystery,” said Alaric, as we
paced up and down Mrs. Osborne’s long verandah,
whilst the monsoon torrents poured and splashed outside.
“You say you never had them out of your
hands but once—and when was that?”</p>

<p>“The day before I sailed,” I replied, “when I was
in London with Linda, I broke the string, and we
went out and left the necklace at a shop, a middling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
sort of jewellers, near our middling sort of hotel, and
said we would call back for it that evening, which we
did. It was getting dusk, and after a little delay a
woman, whom I had not seen before, found the pearls
and handed them to me; the charge was three shillings,
and we thought it extravagant for just a string
of cotton!”</p>

<p>“I see it! I see light!” exclaimed Alaric, coming
to a standstill. “By mistake, she gave you
another necklace—a necklace of real pearls—and has
never been able to trace it! Letty, it must be our
first business, when we get home, to find this woman,
and restore the treasure-trove.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Alaric faithfully fulfilled his promise; he and
Linda and I, after some difficulty, discovered the
jeweller’s shop, but it was closed and “To Let.”
We enquired for the late tenant, and were informed
that his name was Hobhouse; he had had a lot of
trouble, become a bankrupt, and completely disappeared.
After long and vexatious delay we
eventually traced the man to a small seaside town,
where he was endeavouring to earn money as a working
jeweller, whilst his wife took in a humble class
of summer lodgers. In a little formal row of thin
red-brick houses we knocked at number nine, and the
door was opened by Mrs. Hobhouse herself. When
she beheld us she turned a ghastly colour.</p>

<p>“Tom, it’s <i>them</i>!” she screamed to someone in
the back of the premises, “the two girls come at
last!” Then she staggered into a musty little sitting-room
and collapsed on the sofa in floods of
hysterical tears. Her husband now joined us, a thin,
careworn man, who was evidently trembling with
agitation. As soon as Mrs. Hobhouse could speak
(she subsequently did all the talking) she informed us
that a most valuable heirloom had been entrusted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
her husband for some slight repairs. It was a family
treasure, but her ladyship knew that Hobhouse was
as honest as the sun. In the dusk she herself had
given me the treasure by mistake, and next day
handed the mock pearls to the countess! Of course
there was an awful outcry—terrible work. Hobhouse
had done everything he could to trace me; employed
detectives, and advertised far and wide—even to
America—but all to no purpose. They were sued by
the countess, who had been deprived of her ancestral
pearls—and implacably sold up.</p>

<p>Ruined alike in money and credit—and that just
as they were beginning to make a start—no one would
believe them—no, not their own relatives; but all the
world wondered what they had done with the Warrenford
pearls?</p>

<p>I handed them over to Hobhouse when he entered,
and never, never shall I forget his gasp of relief.
(Strange to say, my own imitation pearls still remained
in their possession, and when I departed I
carried them away.) Poor people, their joy, ecstasy,
and thankfulness was touching; for my own part, I
felt painfully overwhelmed as I listened to the list of
extraordinary misfortunes of which <i>I</i> had been the
unconscious cause.</p>

<p>That same evening I wrote to Lady Warrenford,
the owner of the pearls; and thanks to her good
offices, and a substantial cheque from Alaric, Mr. and
Mrs. Hobhouse are once more reinstated, and doing
a flourishing business.</p>

<p>Linda and I are no longer Miss Harlowe and Miss
Letty Harlowe, but Mrs. Fortescue and Mrs. Sandars.
It is Miss Pinfold’s proud boast that her prophecy
respecting <i>me</i> has been nobly fulfilled; thanks to her
urgent entreaties and advice, I was persuaded to
adventure to India, and, as a natural consequence,
had made a magnificent match!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>I have no doubt that my inquisitive maid marvels,
when arranging the famous Sandars’ diamonds and
other jewels, she finds treasured among these, a
string of very ordinary imitation pearls.</p>

<p>But thereby hangs a tale!</p>

THE HELPER</h2>

<p class="ph1">“THE POWER BEHIND THE PEN”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Reverend Maurice Hay died suddenly of
heart failure, his parishioners were full of solicitude
and sympathy for his orphan girls, Rose and
Josephine, who, in spite of youth and good looks,
were very popular in Dullditch and its neighbourhood.
As it was understood that they had no fortune
beyond their pretty faces, no investments, except certain
paltry accomplishments, their affairs naturally
furnished a subject of burning interest; the villagers
laid their heads together, and wondered what on earth
the Hay girls were to do! Lady helps, lady nurses,
companions, typists, these attractive and genteel
posts were urged upon them, but the Hays decided
that they would go together to London, and
endeavour to find work as artists. The community
disapproved and remonstrated—singly, in couples,
and by letter. When these good-natured efforts
proved unavailing, it was remembered that the Vicar’s
daughters had foreign blood in their veins; their
mother’s father was an Italian, and an Italian painter—two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
facts much to be deplored. His queer, roving,
Bohemian ideas were manifesting themselves in his
descendants; yet it was admitted that the Hay girls
had some taste for drawing. Rose’s clever black-and-white
sketches decorated most of her friends’
albums; Josephine painted quite recognisable miniatures—gratis.
She had curly brown locks, a merry,
round face, a pink-and-white complexion, and resembled
one of Cosway’s masterpieces.</p>

<p>Rose, with her dark hair and eyes, and ivory skin,
was like her own particular branch of art, a charming
study in black and white.</p>

<p>The sisters had no near relatives, no one to advise,
help, or control them; with regard to their future
plans, they were not merely determined, but sanguine.
It was their intention to settle in London, and with a
few good introductions, and plenty of hard work, they
expected to make their fortune, and by and by fly
down to visit dear old Dullditch, in a splendid 45 h.p.
motor-car!</p>

<p>Those who had interest through friends—or even
friends’ friends—wrote letters, and did their utmost
to give the orphans a start; and before very long,
armed with introductions and fortified with advice,
they departed full of hope and ambition. At first
they dispatched glowing descriptions of their “upper
part,” the cheapness of London, the numbers and
quality of their invitations—and orders; but two
years had now passed, correspondence had languished,
letters had ceased to arrive at Dullditch, and there
was no sign whatever of the 45 h.p. motor-car!</p>

<p>The truth was, the young amateurs had ceased to
be a novelty—other more interesting strangers had
arrived. London likes a change, the Hays had lost
their hold on their little circle; their spirits and good
looks were clouded, orders and invitations had become
painfully rare, and in the pushing, hustling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
world the two pretty sisters were thrust aside, and
forgotten.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was a wet November evening, and Josephine Hay
sat by a fire of cheap, bad coal, awaiting her sister’s
return from an errand in the City. Their home was
the upper part of a shabby little house in West Kensington;
here they rented two rooms, back and front,
as well as a den on the stairs, which served for cooking—when
there was anything to cook. The front
apartment was dining-, sitting-room, and studio
combined; a deal table, covered with drawing
materials, stood in either window, a decrepit horsehair
sofa and a deformed cane chair were drawn up to
the fire, and between them was placed a tray, with
tea-things, as well as half a stale loaf and a pot of
apple and blackberry jam.</p>

<p>By the capricious gleams of the smouldering coals,
Josephine was counting the contents of her lean
leather purse; count as she would, including coppers
and one stamp, the grand total came to one pound,
three shillings, and seven pence.</p>

<p>She hastily snapped the purse, and turned on the
light, as the door opened to admit her sister, who
was a wet and miserable spectacle.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rosie, you are drowned!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Not quite”—coming forward and putting down
a flat parcel; “it is a dreadful night.” As she spoke,
she peeled off her damp gloves with tender care, and
then proceeded to remove her boots. Meanwhile
Josephine prepared to make tea.</p>

<p>“There’s a boot for you!” Rose said, exhibiting
a small dilapidated specimen; “it’s like a cullender—they
both are; no charwoman would own them!”</p>

<p>“And your stockings are soaking!”</p>

<p>“Oh, they will dry on,” was the courageous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
answer, and she held her well-darned hose to the fire.</p>

<p>“No luck, I suppose?” said Josephine after a
moment’s silence.</p>

<p>“None—I’ll tell you all about it, as soon as I’ve
had my tea. I’m so thirsty, and so hungry—and——”
Here she reached for the loaf and began to
cut it.</p>

<p>“And tired,” said her sister, concluding the sentence;
“you walked home, Rose, and it’s five long
miles.”</p>

<p>“No, I took a penn’orth of bus—instead of a bun—and
now I’ll take it out of the loaf, O housekeeper.
Ah!” raising a cup of tea to her lips, “this is
delicious. I was thinking of this happy moment, as
I paddled along in the rain.—What have you done,
Joe?”</p>

<p>“I went to Queen’s Gate with the miniatures, and
saw Miss Wiggin. She was <i>so</i> disagreeable, and
cross and dissatisfied. She said it was not the least
like her—or if it is, she had no idea she was so plain.”</p>

<p>“I could have told her that,” declared Rose.</p>

<p>“And—she supposed, as it was an order—and she
muttered something about charity, which I could not
afford to hear—that she must take it—when it was
altered to her satisfaction. She insists on a better
complexion, and a new nose; so I have brought it
home instead of the three guineas—and I know I
shall never please her. How did you fare?”</p>

<p>“Much the same! It has been a bad day altogether.
I took my illustrations of ‘A Drowned Girl’s
Diary’ to Puffit &amp; Smack, and the Art Editor, a
superior young man, with a pince-nez and a high-pitched
nose, received the sketches between two disdainful
fingers, and then examined them through his
glasses, and said:</p>

<p>“‘Dear me, Miss Hay! These will never do.
You have no idea of anatomy; this girl has two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
elbows in her arm—and the man is a freak! The
editor has complained of your work, and—er—I’m
really afraid we cannot—er—accept any more of it;
you might try the comic papers.’”</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” ejaculated the housekeeper.</p>

<p>“Fancy his attempting to be funny, whilst he took
the bread out of my mouth. The <i>Week End</i> is my
only employer, since the <i>Kestrel</i> dropped me—and
died.”</p>

<p>“And Miss Wiggin assured <i>me</i> that I need not
expect any further orders from her friends; she was
in earnest, and a temper, so what are we to do?”</p>

<p>“Ask old Mrs. Mote to lend us five pounds—or go
out and sell matches?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe, I’d rather sell matches. I should hate
to borrow, though she is a dear old thing. Our
affairs would be all over Dullditch.”</p>

<p>“If we are found in a garret starved to death, and
the fact is printed in scare lines in the <i>Daily Mail</i>,
our affairs will also be the talk of the village; however,
never say die! I’ve brought back the sketches,
and I’ll have another try—it means twenty-five
shillings.”</p>

<p>“And the rent,” said Josephine. “I cannot understand
how we do so badly—we got on swimmingly at
first; visitors, orders, promises, payment, theatre
tickets, invitations—and <i>now</i>!”</p>

<p>“People were kind. We were new, unsophisticated,
fresh and green from the country; but only a
pair of clever, self-confident amateurs. We have
done our best; it is not in us to do more—to excel.”</p>

<p>“Unless we could go over to Paris, and work
there.”</p>

<p>“Might as well talk of going to heaven.”</p>

<p>“Goodness knows I work hard,” continued Josephine,
with a catch in her breath; “I study all the
pictures I can, I run into the National Gallery on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
free days, and stare, and ponder, and wish, and
wonder; but it’s all something so far above me—Genius—Genius—Genius!”</p>

<p>Her sister nodded a grave assent.</p>

<p>“I hear girls talking of effect, and atmosphere, and
technique, but there is something spiritual in Art,
and in the work of great masters; it seems such a
waste of a precious gift, when they die, and their
marvellous power is lost to the world for ever. Oh,
if they could only bequeath their faculties as they bequeath
their riches! How grateful I should be for a
tiny legacy—even for a crumb.”</p>

<p>“And so should I,” agreed Rose, “the smallest
contribution thankfully received; unfortunately there
is no use in wishing. We are just a dull, plodding,
stupid couple, who have exhausted our resources, and
the patience of our—friends. I begin to see myself
returning to ‘the Ditch,’ as mother’s help to Mrs.
Gull, the baker’s wife; there I shall at least be sure of
a roof and bread. Well, there is no use in looking
at the worst side of a picture. To-morrow I intend to
make a fresh start; I shall copy your figure, and if
you like you may borrow my nose, for the miniature.
It is nice and straight—my best feature.”</p>

<p>“Really, Rose, you are wonderful!” exclaimed
her sister. “What spirits you have!—no matter
what happens, they never seem to sink.”</p>

<p>“I hope we shall both <i>swim</i>—some day,” she
answered, rising as she spoke. “And now that my
petticoats and stockings are dry, I am going to bed.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“’Pon my word—eh—it’s really—er—yes, quite
good!” exclaimed the Art Editor. “Comes all right
this time, Miss Hay; it only wanted a little pains,
you see! You were getting slack. This is one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
your best drawings—so much life in it—the anatomy
correct—excellent. Did anyone help you?” and he
gave her a sharp glance over his glasses.</p>

<p>“Oh no, indeed,” she replied eagerly, “it is
entirely my own work.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” he answered dubiously. “I must
confess that people would hardly credit that this lifeless
performance,” drawing out a former sketch,
“and this,” tapping her latest production, “were the
work of the same hand. One is the well-meant
attempt of an amateur, the other is the—ah, I will
not flatter you to your face—it is capital.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad you are pleased,” said Rose, with
a tinge of colour in her pale face—praise and encouragement
were indeed rare. “Am I to do the
remainder?” she added timidly.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, but in your later style; you may always
depend upon commissions if you stick to that. I expect
you would like a little cheque,” and he sat down
and scribbled one for twenty-five shillings; then, as
he handed it to her, he cleared his throat, and said,
“To be quite frank, this was intended to have been
your last payment—but now that you have shown
what you can accomplish, when you <i>try</i>, I hope we
shall continue to do business together. It,” and he
smiled, “was rather a narrow squeak. I cannot
think why you have hitherto hid your light under a
bushel. This sketch,” once more examining it, “is—er—really
quite good.”</p>

<p>Here, as the telephone rang passionately, he offered
his hand with an air of graceful dismissal, and bowed
her to the door.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five shillings and compliments,” announced
Rose, as she handed the little cheque to her
sister.</p>

<p>“Three guineas—and gush!” rejoined Josephine,
with a delighted laugh. “Miss Wiggin is enchanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
with your nose—highly flattered, and said it was so
admirably truthful to life! She took the miniature
away to the drawing-room, and exhibited it to some
friends—then she called me in. A man who was an
artist talked of ‘fine technical achievement,’ ‘a subtle
interpretation of a personality,’ and other grand
terms. The main thing was, he <i>liked</i> it; and I received
two orders. Miss Wiggin was so fascinated
with her picture, she kept looking, and looking at it,
and could not bear to put it down. She has ordered
another copy, and she asked me such an odd
question.”</p>

<p>“Your age?—your dressmaker’s address?”</p>

<p>“No, you silly, silly girl, but if I had painted it
myself?”</p>

<p>“And you replied, ‘Of course—who else?’”</p>

<p>“Yes, but she said, ‘The reason I ask is, that it is
so <i>very</i> superior to your general work—such dash—and
yet such finish.’</p>

<p>“I can see that myself. When I was working on
it I felt as if I were inspired, and influenced; I was in
a sort of raging fever—my brush flew here and there,
and instead of making a hideous muddle, every stroke
told!”</p>

<p>“Imagine drawing inspiration from the face of a
Miss Wiggin!” exclaimed Rose.</p>

<p>“Imagine it, indeed! The miniature is to be exhibited.
It may make my fortune. It <i>is</i> good—I
feel it in my bones.”</p>

<p>“Poor dear Joe—your bones are prominent
enough!”</p>

<p>“At any rate, I believe we have turned the corner.
We have four pounds five in hand, and the rent—how
shall we spend it?”</p>

<p>“A good lunch, and a matinée?” suggested Rose.</p>

<p>“Certainly not. We spend it—but on boots, real
boots, not brown paper—and gloves, the signs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
gentlefolk. Perhaps hats—I know a very cheap
place, and appearances are so important.”</p>

<p>“So is food,” broke in her sister; “let us celebrate
our good luck with something for supper—sausages
on toast, strawberry jam, and sponge-cakes? A feast
for the gods!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The artists continued to prosper; their tide of success
flowed steadily—fortune increased with fame.
Miniatures by J. Hay were much sought for; Josephine
had more orders than she could execute—her
reputation was firmly established. As for Rose—the
name of “R. Hay” on a black-and-white sketch was
a guarantee of excellence; she illustrated important
books, and where once she was thankful for shillings,
she now received sovereigns. Former acquaintances
recalled the sisters—and their own active benevolence
to a couple of struggling strangers—and prided themselves
on their perspicuity. They looked up the
Hays, deluged them with invitations, and enquired
“where they had been hiding for the last twelve
months?”</p>

<p>“Nothing succeeds like success.” The portraits
of the sister artists appeared in popular papers and
magazines, their names in paragraphs, and in lists of
guests at various famous houses.</p>

<p>They no longer rented an “upper part,” but a
smart and commodious flat in a fashionable locality,
and employed two servants, and a Court dressmaker.
Their strides in their art were amazing, even to themselves.
Once, as Rose completed a spirited sketch,
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Now this really <i>is</i> good! So good, that I can
hardly believe I have drawn it myself, but that I am
a mere automaton, worked by—a—a—certain—something—a
hidden power!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Do you know, <i>I</i> have often felt that too,” said
Josephine, “as if some masterful personality helped
me—a peculiar inspiration directed my hand, guided
it rapidly, and resolutely, to unerring achievement
and success!”</p>

<p>Her sister looked at her with an air of grave surprise.
“I wonder if this could be so?” she murmured.</p>

<p>The pen in Josephine’s fingers suddenly wrote on
the margin of her work the words:</p>

<p>“Yes, it is so.”</p>

<p>She stared at the sentence in fascinated silence,
then turning hastily about, said:</p>

<p>“Oh, Rose, do come and see what the pen has just
written of itself! What can it mean? I declare on
my honour I did not originate this.”</p>

<p>“I see.... I believe it is what is called automatic
writing,” said Rose, after a significant pause.
“I have heard of it. Do try if it will write more.
See, here is a sheet of clean paper—now write a question.”</p>

<p>“Do you help my sister?” Josephine wrote
obediently.</p>

<p>“Yes, and yourself,” came the reply.</p>

<p>“We are most grateful to you. Were you a great
artist?”</p>

<p>“I am—a great artist,” wrote the power behind
the pen.</p>

<p>“May we know your name?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“What may we call you?”</p>

<p>“Helper.”</p>

<p>“Can we do anything for you?”</p>

<p>“Pray.”</p>

<p>“Will you continue to help us?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Is it not uncanny?” said Josephine. “Do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
think I wrote this?—or the artist?—or is it one of the
modern discoveries—my subconscious self coming to
the surface?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” replied Rose, “but it explains all my
success, and yours. The help arrived precisely when
we were at our wits’ end. Don’t you remember, that
wet November night—how we talked of lost gifts, and
inspiration? I believe he came then.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember that night well.”</p>

<p>“We were two wretched little painstaking
amateurs, without one spark, or glimmer, of genius.
Now we are ‘true artists’; even the wickedest critic
admits this. The Helper has been our master, has
taught us, and set his own work once more before the
public, drawn by our feeble fingers; it is the hand of
the dead reincarnated in ours—we are in tune with
some unknown mystery.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we had better keep the mystery to ourselves,”
said Rose the practical, and she stood up,
and put the sheet of paper in the fire.</p>

<p>“Do you think it wrong, Rosie?—are we what is
called ‘possessed’?”</p>

<p>“No—did he not ask us to pray? And we will.
Why should not a departed spirit show kindness, and
give charity to others? You and I are the objects of
his benevolence—but for him, God knows what would
have become of us!”</p>

<p>After this experience, it became an everyday matter
to carry on a little correspondence with the Helper,
who proved to be the Hays’ mainstay for many
months; but at last he gave notice of his departure,
in these words:</p>

<p>“You can now walk, and work alone—and another
sorely needs assistance.”</p>

<p>“For a picture?” wrote Josephine.</p>

<p>“Yes, an important picture, which may make his
fortune. A picture like this,” and with a few telling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
strokes the pen rapidly sketched a desert scene, a sunset,
and a great caravan, with many kneeling figures;
in the foreground two horses and two men; in the far
distance, a passing sandstorm. Under this sketch
the pen wrote, ‘Good-bye.’</p>

<p>“How we shall miss him,” said Rose, with a sigh;
“though it is true that we are able to walk alone,—especially
since we have had those lessons in Paris.”</p>

<p>“I shall always treasure the sketch,” said her
sister, “our Helper’s last writing, and message. I
shall lock it away in my desk.”</p>

<p>Two years elapsed, and ‘R. and J. Hay’ continued
to prosper; they visited Dullditch—but not by motor—and
during a holiday on the Continent happened
by chance to enter a fine exhibition of modern
paintings.</p>

<p>As she moved along slowly and conscientiously,
catalogue in hand, Rose was accosted by Josephine,
who looked so agitated and pale, that she was justly
alarmed.</p>

<p>“Are you ill?” she asked. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“<i>The picture is here</i>,” she whispered excitedly.
“Come, it is in the next room—the Helper’s picture
of the desert. Oh, it is a masterpiece!—I could
scarcely get near it for the crowd.”</p>

<p>Then, when at last an opening was obtained, Rose
beheld the finished result of the sketch in her sister’s
desk—correct in every particular.</p>

<p>There was the vast desert, the passing of a great
sandstorm, the setting of a red sun, and a halted
caravan. It was the hour of prayer and thanksgiving;
a multitude of the faithful had prostrated themselves
towards Mecca; in the foreground, two
Europeans, dismounted, held their Arab horses, as
they stood bare-headed, gazing towards the east.</p>

<p>On referring to the catalogue, the sisters read:</p>

<p>“409.—After the Sirocco. Anon.”</p>

THE FATAL PARAGRAPH</h2>

<p class="ph1">A TRAGEDY</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is scarcely possible that many women have led a
more dull, monotonous, miserable life than Annie
Fleude; actual want, and the real nip of actual
poverty, with some variety and excitement, would
have been preferable! All her days since she left
school—and she was now thirty—had been dedicated
to querulous old people. Her uncle, a paralytic, who
lived at Camberwell—in a gloomy, semi-detached
house overlooking a damp garden—had engrossed the
entire summer of her youth. Her stagnant existence
had been narrowed to the routine of the household,
and the only breaks she enjoyed were an occasional
Sunday School Treat, a Magic Lantern Lecture, or a
Summer Sale!</p>

<p>When Mr. Jonas Fleude died he left his niece thirty
pounds a year, and figuratively handed her on to his
sister, Mrs. Pyzer, a deaf old lady residing in the
Midlands, and here, if possible, Annie’s case was
worse—she had jumped out of the frying-pan into the
fire!</p>

<p>The locality in which Mrs. Pyzer resided was
neither town, village, nor country, but combined all
the drawbacks, and none of the advantages, of the
three. Battsbridge was a collection of houses near a
cross-road in Flatshire. These had been built in the
immediate vicinity of a once celebrated posting inn—a
hostelry of no little importance in the old coaching
days. It was situated on the great North Road—cautiously
aloof from the temptations of a market<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
town—capable of accommodating many guests, and
its stables received one hundred and fifty horses. But
time and the railway had brought changes, and
diverted the traffic elsewhere. The stables fell into
ruins, the inn was turned into six cottages, and the
inn’s parasites alone remained!—four substantial detached
houses of the Georgian period, red-faced, ugly,
and close to the road, with little mean enclosures,
flagged paths in front, and large straggling gardens
at the rear. They were of different sizes and ages,
but were all at the same side of the highway, facing
north, and resembled substantial suburban residences
which had ventured into the country—and gone
astray!</p>

<p>Besides these houses, Battsbridge boasted a large
forge and a tiny post-office—where sweets, tobacco,
and stationery were sold. The parish church was two
miles by road—and one mile across the fields and
stiles. The nearest town and railway-station was
four miles distant along a dreary, monotonous stretch
of the great North Road. Here, at Idleford, a fine
old county town, were shops, a market square, a town
hall, two churches, and a considerable railway-station.
It was one of Ann Fleude’s few relaxations to plod
to this station, buy a paper or two from the tempting
bookstall, watch the passengers depart and arrive,
and witness the great Scotch expresses, with their
huge green engines, thunder by. She often lingered
for the best part of an hour (there was nothing attractive
awaiting her at home), solaced herself with refreshment-room
tea and buns, and boldly pretended
that she was expecting the arrival of a friend! These
expeditions to Idleford station were her gala days—think
of it! Her aunt, Mrs. Pyzer, was ill-tempered,
tyrannical, rheumatic, and deaf. Her two servants,
ancient retainers, were elderly women settled in their
ways; the rooms were low and dark, and held a perpetual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
atmosphere of mouldy hay. No sun ever
entered them, and with the consent of Mrs. Pyzer and
her servants—no <i>air</i>. The furniture dated from the
epoch of the old lady’s marriage—when black horsehair
and solid mahogany was the rage; the beds were
four-posters, with bolsters and mattresses stuffed with
rank and noisome feathers of fabulous age: the whole
character of the house was to correspond—nothing
young or modern was ever to be found within it. Its
mistress objected to new-fangled ways, she disliked
cut flowers, pet animals, or even birds, and lived
apparently in a world of her own—the past.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pyzer did not appear till lunch-time, and then
she was always accompanied by shawls, cushions,
and her ear-trumpet. Her food consisted of mince
and milk puddings; her drink was hot brandy and
water. She subscribed to the parish magazine, a
local weekly paper, and some missionary journals,
but set her face sternly against novels, cards and
callers. The oldest and (in her own opinion) most respected
residence of Battsbridge, she believed that
she had done a deed of remarkable benevolence in
giving a home to her niece Annie, whom she looked
upon as a mere child—but nevertheless expected her
to share the tastes of a woman who was eighty-one
last birthday.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones, the doctor, and his wife, resided at
Battsbridge, also two faded old sisters, the Misses
Horn-Finch, and in the largest and most important of
the four houses dwelt the widow of a late rector, a
certain Mrs. Brandon, who considered herself, like her
abode, to be vastly superior to her neighbours. She
owned the largest garden, also a thatched arbour, and
a greenhouse, kept three maids, and was visited by
the County; and it was to Mrs. Brandon that Annie
Fleude looked for all her little pleasures. Now and
then she lent her a book—a new novel—or invited her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
to tea, or took her out driving, when she hired a
brougham from Idleford, and made a few calls (leaving
Annie meanwhile sitting in the carriage). Annie
was not acquainted with the resident gentry; indeed,
it was no secret that her father had been a bankrupt
auctioneer—though Mrs. Pyzer, his sister, had married
far above her deserts, a retired Major from a
West Indian regiment, and always spoke of herself
as “a Military Lady.”</p>

<p>Annie’s days were all precisely alike—week after
week—month after month—year after year. As soon
as she had breakfasted, she dusted the drawing-room,
did some sewing and mending, and watered the plants
in the frame. They dined at three o’clock; when she
had settled her aunt, told her all the news, and left
her to doze, she went forth on the household messages,
such as to a farm for eggs and butter, to a
cottager for chickens, or for a solitary aimless walk
along the country road; then came seven o’clock tea,
a game of backgammon, a bowl of bread and milk,
and to bed—and the next morning <i lang="it">da capo</i>.</p>

<p>Annie Fleude had endured this existence for three
weary years, notwithstanding determined and desperate
efforts to effect a release. She walked to
church twice on Sundays, and in all weathers, and
taught laboriously in the Sunday-school, until the
announcement of the curate’s marriage—the wretch
had been secretly engaged for years! Then there was
the Rector, a hale, rosy-cheeked old gentleman of
seventy—he was undoubtedly flattered by her profound
interest in his sermons; he lent her books, she
knitted him socks, accepted his invitation to tea, and
to see his roses; all was going admirably, till some
wicked interfering person sounded a note of alarm,
and one of his married daughters appeared upon the
scene—so <i>that</i> chance of escape was barred! There
was a yearly subscription ball in Idleford. To this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Miss Fleude went once, wearing a new black net
gown, her hair beautifully dressed, and chaperoned
by the doctor’s wife—but alas, she was a wallflower!
No one noticed her, or “requested the pleasure of a
dance,” except the young man from the station bookstall,
and the chemist’s assistant.</p>

<p>There were various bazaars, where Miss A. Fleude
served on committees, and assisted at stalls, carried
dolls for raffles, dipped in bran-pies, and was gay,
vivacious, and useful, and pretended to enjoy herself!
Local ladies, when comparing notes, said:</p>

<p>“That Miss Fleude at Battsbridge isn’t a bad sort
of person—I shall ask her to help me at my rummage
sale.”</p>

<p>But even at the rummage sales poor Annie failed to
find a likely suitor! And yet poor Annie was not
plain: tall, flat-backed, with rather a long face, thick
brown hair, fine brown eyes, a passable nose, and
beautiful white teeth. Sometimes she would stare
at herself in her little spotted mirror, with a drawer
beneath it, and shake her head at her reflection, and
say:</p>

<p>“Oh, you wretched, blighted sort of creature!
Whatever were you born for, <i>I</i> should like to know?
Have you ever had one really happy day to look back
upon—one splendid, dazzling hour? And yet you
are not ugly, you are not an idiot, you have thirty
pounds a year—and more to come. But what is the
good of it all? No one wants you—you are like a
thing in prison, and the best that could happen to
you would be to have a nice, easy, painless sort of
illness—and to <i>die</i>!”</p>

<p>As she thus wished for her own demise, tears would
rise into her eyes and trickle down her face; then she
would shake her fist at her reflection, and say:</p>

<p>“Annie, you must buck up! When things come
to the worst, they mend. I’ll subscribe to the library,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
I’ll buy a bicycle, and I’ll stick up for myself more
than I do; everyone imposes on <i>me</i> because I am so
good-natured. I’m called ‘Gentle Annie.’ I mend
Mrs. Brandon’s lace—yes, and her stockings—I go
messages for the Finches, and I teach the Jones’ child
music. I take the smallest piece of cake, the weakest
cup of tea—but I’m not going to be good-natured and
gentle any more, but fierce and aggressive, and fighting,
and I’ll just see how that will answer!”</p>

<p>But these good resolutions were generally of short
duration—her courage evaporated within an hour;
she had arranged her aunt’s knitting, shrieked
through the ear-trumpet till she was hoarse, undertook
other people’s distasteful tasks, and was just as
obedient, “gentle,” and good-natured as ever.</p>

<p>At last cruel Fortune remembered her captive, the
unfortunate woman, who never had a gleam of sun
in her life, who had no one to love and to care for—for
who could care for Mrs. Pyzer? a passionate,
selfish, and greedy old beldame—a woman whose life
was passing away, as if she were a stone at the bottom
of a disused well.</p>

<p>Light and hope came to Annie through the misfortune
of another. Mrs. Brandon, who had been becoming
more and more near-sighted, had recently
consulted a specialist, who announced “cataract on
both eyes.” This was a terrible verdict to a woman
so fond of reading, so active in her garden, and such
an indefatigable correspondent. However, after the
first shock, she pulled herself together, and seriously
considered the situation. She would be obliged to
employ a companion and secretary—what a bore to
have a strange woman (who would probably be
odious) with her continually day after day, and she
becoming blinder and blinder, and falling by degrees
into that other woman’s power. A stranger would
read her letters, would see her accounts, examine her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
bank-book, and would probably require a handsome
salary. Mrs. Brandon began to look through a list
of her connections. There was Constance Talbot, a
woman of a certain age, who would no doubt be glad
of a temporary home; but she would never stand the
dulness of the place, and always be wanting to run
about the country, to lunch, and bridge. Then there
was her widowed niece, Mrs. Forrest; but she had
such an awful tongue, and was a most dangerous
gossip. No, no, Sissie Forrest would never do.
Suddenly an idea dawned upon her! Why should
she not make use of good-natured Annie Fleude, who
had ample time on her hands, a pleasant voice, and
wrote a good hand? She need not pay her a penny—on
the contrary, Annie would look upon the employment
as an honour, and a favour; she would be
only too thankful for a few hours to escape from that
odious, deaf old woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brandon in appearance was tall, commanding,
and arrogant, with a high aquiline nose and piercing
black eyes. In character she was hard, determined
and ambitious; her manner to her inferiors was uncertain.
One day she would be confidential, and even
sympathetic, another distant, and disagreeable. It
was no secret that she had a handsome fortune (twelve
hundred a year) when as an heiress who was “getting
on,” she had given her hand to the Rector of Froom,
and resignedly settled herself to enact the <i lang="fr">rôle</i> of
parson’s wife. The Rector had survived ten years,
and died, leaving his widow a well-to-do matron, with
one son, who had now been in India for a considerable
time.</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Brandon had made up her mind
about a suitable companion, she sent in for Annie
Fleude, and having bitterly bewailed her sad circumstances,
threw herself upon her kindness and good-nature—but
made no mention of any remuneration;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
and Annie, who was only too pleased to find that she
could be of valuable assistance to such an important
neighbour, entered upon her duties without delay.
But the Misses Horn-Finch (ever interested in other
people’s affairs) took counsel with the doctor’s wife,
and the curate’s bride, and said:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Brandon really ought to pay—she can well
afford it, but she is very mean in some ways. She
uses Annie as a companion, makes her read all the
papers, write all her letters, and manage the house.”</p>

<p>But Annie enjoyed this; Mrs. Brandon’s garden
was pleasant to sit in, indoors her armchairs were delightfully
comfortable, her tea was fragrant, and her
cakes delicious. Annie had the pleasure of reading
the latest news, and the newest books, she met numbers
of nice people in Mrs. Brandon’s modern drawing-room—although
she was never introduced to
them—she liked to see their smart clothes, and listen
to their smart talk. And as for acting as amanuensis—that
was the best of all! Miss Fleude’s own correspondence
was pathetically scanty, and if she liked
one thing better than another, it was to receive a
letter. The few who wrote to her were old school-fellows,
at long intervals, and one or two neighbours
in Camberwell. Sometimes for days and days the
stolid postman would walk past Mrs. Pyzer’s door,
and on two or three occasions Annie had actually
addressed and posted a paper to herself in Idleford—simply
in order to hear his familiar knock! Now
she enjoyed the reading and writing of letters every
day. Once a week Mrs. Brandon dictated a long
epistle to her son, who had an appointment in India
(something to do with indigo). Every one of Mrs.
Brandon’s friends had heard of “Cecil,” of his extraordinary
cleverness at school, his social successes,
his devotion to his parent—but no one had seen him,
for Mrs. Brandon had only come to Battsbridge within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
the last five years. How exciting it was to be corresponding
with a young man, to receive and read
all his replies; these came almost every mail, and
were subsequently secured by elastic bands, and
tidily stored in a japanned box. Annie had been
obliged to explain herself, in her first letter, as the
secretary who was temporarily his mother’s pen and
eyes, and he sent her charming little messages of
thanks, and said:</p>

<p>“How nice and clearly you write, Miss Secretary.
It is delightful to read such handwriting.” Whereupon
his mother exclaimed, “Tut, tut, tut!” but
Annie took greater pains than ever. She, however,
had wit enough to realise that Mrs. Brandon was a
bitterly jealous mother, and that she must be extremely
cautious, and never obtrude her own personality.
The Indian letters were really interesting, and invariably
full of Cecil Brandon; a less experienced eye
might have considered his descriptions florid and
exaggerated, and declared that there was rather too
much of the wonderful exploits of the writer. It is
always so easy to give oneself the <i lang="fr">beau rôle</i> in a
letter!</p>

<p>Cecil Brandon was in the local volunteers; his
mother explained that he had failed for the Army at
home, not through his own fault (of course), and that
as she had a good deal of family interest, she had
found him an excellent post in the Bengal Presidency.
He was delighted with India; the life out there suited
him, even the climate was not to be condemned. Poor
Cecil had always a delicate chest, and the winters at
home had been trying. Sometimes towards the end
of one of his most interesting and affectionate letters,
there would be a playful request for a little cheque.</p>

<p>“You see, he is obliged to keep up his position,
and entertain,” explained his mother; “I’m afraid
he is rather inclined to be extravagant, and that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
can’t help, poor boy. He takes after his grandfather,
Carlyon of Carlyon, and has blue blood in his veins.”</p>

<p>Then she would contemplate her own long hands,
and say, “Blue blood!—blue blood is <i>always</i> generous,”
and yet, at the moment, she was making use
of Annie Fleude, and not giving her the smallest
return. “Cecil is all I have,” she would exclaim,
“and I am ambitious for him—ambition is my one
weakness. There was never much outlook in the
Church for the aspirations of a Rector’s wife—even if
she is well born—but her son in India is different. I
believe Cecil will make himself a name.”</p>

<p>Then she would take up his photograph, and hold
it close to her dim eyes. Cecil’s photographs were
numerous, in many styles and many sizes: in volunteer
uniform, dark green and silver, in a racing
jacket, Indian shikar kit, fancy dress, or plain mufti.
His best portraits were large, merely the head and
shoulders, showing a face with thick wavy hair, a
wide forehead, well-opened eyes, and a large black
moustache.</p>

<p>Between his letters, his mother’s copious reminiscences,
and his many photographs, Annie was already
in love with Cecil Brandon—her very first and possibly
her very last romance. Once she stealthily slipped a
violet into the envelope, and he, in return, sent her a
leaf of lemon-scented verbena, with a line, “For the
pretty secretary.”—Needless to say, she did not read
this aloud.</p>

<p>She treasured the leaf and its inscription, and oh,
folly! put them into a tiny gold locket—but then, you
see, the poor thing had had so little in her life!</p>

<p>It had been a trying winter. Mrs. Pyzer, who had
long been feeble, had now what is called “broken
up.” The backgammon board and the big knitting-pins
were put away in a cupboard—they were not
likely ever to be wanted again. Owing to her aunt’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
condition, Annie was more mistress of her own time;
she ordered the meals, altered the hours, and the old
servants offered no resistance. A will had been made,
and they had reason to believe that they had both
been “well remembered.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be long now,” they remarked to one
another, as they discussed plans over their tea-pot;
“the house and furniture and a small income will go
to Miss Fleude; well, she deserves something—she
has had a poor time, and is getting on.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cecil Brandon’s letters increased in
number and interest; lately he seemed to have done
a great deal of racing; he described his successes, the
club dinners, the compliments paid him, and how he
had been riding for a native prince who had overwhelmed
him with thanks, and presented him with a
magnificent pin. Of his own particular business
there was little information, but a great deal respecting
the Lucknow “week.”</p>

<p>One day a letter arrived; it was short, a mere
scrawl, written in a shaky hand. It said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Darling old Mum</span>,</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened, but I have been very seedy; I
have had a bad go of fever, which I can’t shake off, and
the doctors say I must go home, so I start in a week.”</p>
</div>

<p>“In a week!” repeated Mrs. Brandon. “Why,
then he will be here in a few days! Oh, oh, to think
of it, and he will find me nearly stone-blind! Who
is to get the house ready, and his room, and order
things?—I am so helpless that I must leave this to
strangers, my poor darling sick boy.”</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to mention that Annie
worked <i lang="it">con amore</i>; fresh white curtains were hung
up, new rugs were laid down, the garden was robbed
of flowers, and the old house seemed quite gay and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
festive. As for Annie herself, she had become years
younger, and did not look a day more than five and
twenty. She invested in a neat tailor-made and an
expensive hat, took lessons in dressing and waving
her hair, and presented an unusually smart appearance.
As the critical time drew nearer she could
scarcely sleep with excitement; for once in her life,
when she did wake up in the morning, there was
something to look forward to! At last the great day
dawned, and the traveller arrived from Idleford in a
station cab, which rocked and tottered under piles of
shabby baggage.</p>

<p>As Cecil Brandon descended at his mother’s gate,
Annie with beating pulses inspected him over her
window-blind. Oh, such a little shrivelled, sallow
man! He looked fifty, and terribly ill! In spite of
her severe disappointment, Miss Fleude’s kind heart
went out to him on the spot, with a sort of almost
maternal affection.</p>

<p>The following morning, with her hair beautifully
waved, and wearing the new tailor-made, she went
next door to resume her duties, and make the
acquaintance of Mrs. Brandon’s celebrated son. She
found him delighted to see her, most agreeable and
charming. His mother, however, had one of her
bad days, and was coldly patronising, and distant.
No one would suppose for a moment that all the successful
preparations and clever arrangements were
entirely due to the exertions of her visitor.</p>

<p>It was really surprising the number of matrons
with unmarried daughters who now came to call on
Mrs. Brandon, and make tender enquiries about her
eyesight.</p>

<p>Little Cecil was undoubtedly a ladies’ man, and
enjoyed tea-parties and luncheons, dinners and
bridge; but Annie was his first, his <i>home</i> friend.
Many a day he stole in to see her, or they conferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
together in his mother’s summer-house—he having
assured his parent that he was about to walk into Idleford,
or starting for an afternoon’s fishing, or golf.</p>

<p>“The mater is deadly jealous of <i>you</i>,” he explained,
“but you must not mind her—she knows I
am awfully gone on you, and that’s the reason she
has got her frills up.”</p>

<p>And indeed, in these latter days, Mrs. Brandon
allowed herself to be offensively rude to her secretary
and companion. If she could have dispensed with
her services she would have done so; but who was to
write her letters? Who was to read her the morning
paper? Certainly <i>not</i> Cecil, who rarely got out of
his bed before eleven o’clock. Her increasing blindness
made her frantic; she had an instinctive feeling
that something hateful was going on around her, a
something that she could not see, or divine. After
all, Cecil might flirt with Annie as much as he pleased—a
woman a head over him, thirty years of age, and
a nobody! Her name was really Flood, but some of
her insignificant relations had changed it into Fleude.
They might change the spelling of the name, but
they could not change their status in life. Cecil
must marry well, a somebody, and an heiress, and
as soon as her eyes had been operated upon she was
determined to look about her in good earnest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the happy pair were privately engaged;
they walked together, they bicycled boldly into Idleford,
they sat in the summer-house, and Cecil talked
of himself continually. One of Annie’s chief attractions
was the fact that she was a most patient and
appreciative listener. He really never tired of relating
his wonderful exploits: the mad horses he had
ridden, the snakes he had destroyed, and the tigers
he had shot; in all these stories he filled the <i lang="fr">rôle</i> of a
hero, brave to rashness; and it happened that one
day Annie had an opportunity of judging of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
courage for herself! A wild bullock, which was
being led along the country road, had broken away
from its drover, and, with tail up, and head down,
came charging towards them.</p>

<p>“Look out, look out!” shrieked Cecil—it was
almost the scream of a woman; without another word,
he disappeared over a wall with the agility of a
monkey, and Annie was left to face the coming adventure
alone! She stood her ground bravely, and as
the beast charged, she dashed at him with an open
umbrella, which fortunately had the effect of scaring
the animal; and the valiant lady found herself scathless
and breathless. By and by, she saw two hands
and a little head appearing above the wall, and a
squeaky voice enquired:</p>

<p>“Is he gone? Is the coast clear?” On receiving
an encouraging affirmative—and without blush, or
shame—Cecil pulled himself up, and dropped into
the road. “They don’t often attack a woman—at
least, that is my experience in India,” he explained,
“or of course I wouldn’t have left you; but the fact is—and
I make no secret of it to you—since I have had
this awful go of fever my nerves have completely gone
to pieces! India has skinned them raw.”</p>

<p>After this episode, it is not improbable that Annie
accepted her lover’s amazing experiences with more
than a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>One evening, in the dusk in the summer-house, he
confided to her that he had been in an infernal scrape
in India. It was all about a race, or rather racing;
of course he was as innocent as a new-born babe, but
he had been obliged to chuck it, and bolt! The doctor’s
certificate was a mere excuse. By degrees he
would break this news to the Mum; she would be
furious at first, but she would soon see that he had
been a mere tool in the matter, the cat’s-paw of others;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
and she was so clever and influential that she would
soon find him another and better billet.</p>

<p>Annie was not horrified by this confession; on the
contrary she consoled him, comforted him with her
assurance of his mother’s loyal belief in him, and herself
swallowed every word of his plausible excuses.</p>

<p>These were Annie’s happy days; for if Cecil did
play golf with the Miss Grants, or tennis with the
Miss Thornhills, he spent his evenings with her,
slipping in (after his mother and the servants had
gone to bed) through an open back window, and they
had chicken mayonnaise, and various other delicacies,
prepared by Annie’s clever hands, washed down with
Burgundy, or whisky and seltzer; and Cecil smoked—yes,
actually a meerschaum in Mrs. Pyzer’s dining-room—a
room in which a pipe had not been lit for
half a century! It is scarcely necessary to mention
that the two servants were fully aware of these secret
orgies, but they held their tongues, assented to the
preparations, and washed up the plates; for it would
suit them, supposing, as they expressed it, “anything
happened,” to remain on. Shortly after this,
something did “happen.” Old Mrs. Pyzer died,
and Annie Fleude, now mistress of the house, reigned
in her stead.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The operation for cataract proved immediately
afterwards successful; and Mrs. Brandon had her
eyes opened in another direction, and an entirely different
fashion, by a friend. Cecil, she was informed,
“had got into a most shocking scrape about racing;
it was really scandalous and notorious; the talk of all
the sporting men in India”; but, after her first anger,
the fond mother succumbed to her son’s plausible excuses
and caresses, and endeavoured—since the East<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
was closed to him—to find him another post. To this
he was rather averse, and suggested living at home,
and being her companion and comfort; but Charlotte
Brandon was a Spartan mother, and determined that
her boy should go forth once more into the world’s
battle, and make himself a name. The benighted
parent was ignorant of the fact that he had already
made “a name” as the shadiest gentleman rider in
India—and a thorough-paced little scamp.</p>

<p>Presently the engagement was breathed into her
ear. To this, however, she failed to show the same indulgence.
The ungrateful old woman was beside herself
with fury, heaped abuse on deceitful, scheming
Ann, and forbade her her presence, and her house.</p>

<p>Her tongue became venomous, as she assured her
dear Cecil that it was bad enough for him to disgrace
himself in India, but to come home and marry and
settle down beside her, with a vulgar old maid—never!</p>

<p>“Give her up!” she cried, “give her up at once,
or I will never leave you a penny, and I shall alter
my will.”</p>

<p>She looked, as she was, cold, cast-iron, and nothing
he could do or say would melt her decision. So
he was compelled to agree. He had one long and
tearful interview with Annie; this took place in the
musty old dining-room—from which his sobs and
hers were audible in the kitchen—but on the following
day, when walking with his mother and encountering
his lady-love out of doors, he passed
her without acknowledgment—and looked the other
way.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Annie Fleude was broken-hearted; she
wrote Cecil many piteous, passionate letters, all unavailing;
for he was a weak little fellow, ever
dominated by a stronger will, and hence his defection
and silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>The story of his racing had somehow reached England.
How tiresome it is that in cases where one
would like to keep matters <i>quiet</i>, almost every person
one meets has relations out in India! Girls and their
parents now suddenly cooled; invitations ceased,
even although Cecil Brandon would have £1,200 a
year on the death of his mother, and was undeniably
well connected. However, Mrs. Brandon exerted
herself amazingly. She wrote letters (with her own
hand)—dozen of letters, and she carried Cecil away
from Battsbridge to London, and at last found him a
promising appointment in the Belgian Congo. It
offered fine pay; her son could stand a warm climate,
he had a knack of picking up languages, and he
would return home in two years. In short, it was a
first-rate opening! When all had been arranged, the
little man wrote to Annie to inform her of his prospects,
and to say good-bye. In reply to this letter,
she immediately went up to London and sought an
interview with him and his mother at their hotel.
She was desperate, and determined not to lose her
little lover without a life and death struggle. At first
she was piteous and heartbroken—foolishly endeavouring
to work upon Mrs. Brandon’s feelings.</p>

<p>“I served you for a whole year,” she declared
brokenly. “Could a daughter have done more for
you than I did? Your son loves me, and I love him;
I will make him a good wife. I have enough to live
on, since my aunt is dead. The house is mine, he
will be close to you, and you will have his society,
and the comfort of his being near you. I beg and
implore you not to send him away to the Congo; it is
an awful place; he is all you have, and he is all I
have—let us live at Battsbridge, and be happy. If
you insist on his going to Africa it will break my
heart, for something tells me that I shall never, never—see
him again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>Suddenly she began to sob hysterically, and falling
upon her knees, endeavoured to take Mrs. Brandon’s
hand in hers; but Mrs. Brandon pushed her away
with surprising violence, and rising from her chair,
said:</p>

<p>“Cecil is going to Africa—I am sending him there
on purpose to place him out of <i>your</i> reach!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are a hard, hard woman!” said Annie,
struggling to her feet. “Will nothing I can do, or
say, change you or soften your heart?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>Annie now turned and appealed to Cecil, and in
vain. The battle between two strong women for a
weak man raged, but in the end the mother won.
Out on the lobby Cecil contrived to snatch a few
moments with Annie, assuring her that it would be
all right, and that they would be true to one another,
and be married when he returned in two years’ time.</p>

<p>“Stand up for yourself now,” she answered
fiercely, “stand up for yourself, and me; you are a
man, you are five-and-thirty, and should know your
own mind. We can be independent of your mother,
and I am ready to marry you to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“No, no, no,” he replied, “the mater has so much
in her power, I dare not risk it. Think of all she has
to leave; and if she says that she will cut me off with
a shilling, by Jove, she’ll do it! We will just bide
our time—it will soon pass,” he declared, with cheerful
optimism, “and you and I will be married when
I come back.”</p>

<p>“If you allow your mother to drive you out of the
country,” said Annie, and her face was white and
rigid, “I tell you—that you will <i>never</i> come back!”</p>

<p>At this he gave a funny little cackling laugh, and
said:</p>

<p>“I bet you I will! I lay you fifty to one—eh?”</p>

<p>But Annie made no reply. She turned abruptly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
away, walked slowly down the red carpeted stairs of
the hotel, and never once looked back. It was done—it
was all over! Useless to attempt to dissuade him—he
was as wax in the hands of his parent.</p>

<p>Annie travelled to Battsbridge, a changed woman,
and shut herself up in her dismal house for many
weeks. From time to time—through the neighbours’
talk—she heard that Cecil Brandon was doing
capitally in the Congo, had been promoted to a post
in the rubber district, far up in the Interior, exerted
a wonderful influence on the natives, and had
achieved success at last!</p>

<p>Eight months had elapsed, when the district was
electrified by the news of his death. A brief telegram
announced that he had been suddenly carried off by
a virulent fever, prevalent in the jungle. His
mother was prostrate and inconsolable; but by and
by she roused herself sufficiently to dispatch a beautiful
white marble tombstone to be erected over Cecil’s
grave. The common grief had not drawn her and
her neighbour any closer together; on the contrary,
Annie was now a hard, hopeless, embittered creature,
who burnt with inextinguishable rage against a
mother who had murdered her son. Oh, that she
could punish her! Oh, that she might avenge him!
Vainly and vainly did she cast about in search of a
weapon. At last—she found it!</p>

<p>Miss Fleude, who was now comfortably off, expended
a good deal of money on books, magazines,
and journals; and, since Cecil had been in Africa,
had subscribed to many African papers. By chance
an ill-printed West Coast “rag” fell into her hands,
and there she found, with other weird information, a
terrible story of cannibalism—in which no ghastly
detail was spared.</p>

<p>It appeared that a certain unpopular, tyrannical
overseer had visited an outlying village; that in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
jungle, on his return towards headquarters, he had
become mysteriously separated from his escort, and
some of the natives, finding him, seized and carried
him off, a prisoner. These happened to be of the
Lokele, a tribe of well-known river cannibals, who
wore necklaces of the teeth of those whom they had
eaten. Such had been unquestionably the fate of the
unfortunate official, whose boots and pocket-book
were found, and whose name it had been proved was
“C. Brandon.”</p>

<p>When the agonised reader had come to the end of
this description, she fainted dead away, and was
subsequently confined to her bed for a whole week.
At the end of the week Miss Fleude had recovered her
strength, renewed her animosity, and rekindled her
hatred; she marked the terrible paragraph with three
crosses in ink, folded the paper neatly, and then
addressed and posted it to her next-door neighbour.</p>

<p>It had even more than the desired effect!</p>

<p>Shortly after the postman’s arrival the following
morning, a grating shriek rang through the house,
and when the servants ran to see what had happened,
they found Mrs. Brandon lying back in her chair,
with staring open eyes, quite dead—with the fatal
journal clenched in her hands.</p>

<p>Miss Fleude still continues to reside at Battsbridge;
she is kind and charitable to the poor, but holds herself
coldly aloof from her neighbours, who, to tell the
truth, are secretly afraid of the lady, and no longer
speak of her as “Gentle Annie.”</p>

THE SHIP’S CAT</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Truman</span>, till recently the heir of a man of large
property, but now a mere pauper without home or
profession, sat in a big morocco-covered chair, with
his hands in his pockets, listening to his future
father-in-law, Boaz Pottinger, Esq., whilst he expounded
his opinions, and more or less laid down
the law.</p>

<p>Mr. Pottinger had acquired a fortune in chemical
works, and it was his almost daily boast that he was
“a self-made man.” His detractors declared that
this was not much to be proud of, and that Boaz
Pottinger, ugly, ungainly, uncouth, had omitted to
supply himself with the letter “h.” However, he
had a ladylike wife, a pretty daughter, and half a
million, so when he bought a place in Kent the neighbours
figuratively made room for him. No one was
more friendly than the Squire of the parish, Hildebrande
Truman, whose ancestors were Crusaders, and
who had never earned a penny in his life. As times
were bad for agriculturists, Mr. Truman attempted to
make some money in speculation, but kept his endeavours
to himself, intending to treat his wife and
family to a delightful surprise! Unfortunately, the
surprise was not of the nature he anticipated. On
the collapse of a monstrous financial swindle he became
liable, involved, ruined, and within a few
months, Daines Place, its estates and messuages and
heirlooms, were brought to the hammer, and sold.
The shock, and the shame, had killed the Squire, and
now here was the Squire’s son listening to Mr.
Pottinger’s ideas on the subject of his future!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>Mr. Pottinger enjoyed the sound of his own voice
as he lay back in his chair, with his thick white fingers
meeting at the tips, his eyes fixed on a corner of a
bookcase. He said:</p>

<p>“You see, Jack, my boy, everything is altered now
the poor Squire has gone, and scarcely left a penny
piece—or anyway not more than will keep your
mother and sisters in a small way. If he had only
given <i>me</i> a hint of what he was after, I’d have warned
him. I know all about the smiling scoundrels, that
rob honest folks, not of shillings, but of ’undreds of
thousands of pounds, and call themselves honourable
men. Well, if I’d ’ad a ’int, you would not be sitting
there—without an acre to your name!”</p>

<p>“No,” sighed the young man, “but there is no
use in going over that now, and the governor meant
it all for the best. The question is, what am I to do
to make a living for Nancy and myself?”</p>

<p>“Talk of making your own living, my son.—We
will leave Nancy out of the business.”</p>

<p>“But Nancy is engaged to me, with your consent,
and she intends to stick to me—and I to her.”</p>

<p>“Circumstances have changed since this time last
year. Then you were heir to a fine property, and
would ’ave ’ad a suitable allowance. Now what ’ave
you got? What are you and Nancy going to live on—tell
me that? ’Ow are you going to put a ’ouse
over ’er ’ead?”</p>

<p>“That is just the crucial question,” replied young
Truman, rising to his feet. He was slight and well
made, with a square chin, and fine head—the typical
young Britisher who has been to Eton and Oxford;
his clothes and boots were the perfection of cut—in
short, he appeared what he was, a good-looking man
of fashion, who had never earned, or lacked, a
sovereign in his life.</p>

<p>“You have no profession,” resumed Mr. Pottinger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“No, that’s the worst of it. I did not care about
the Army—I wanted to be a sailor, and my mother
struck; and here I am—at twenty-four—an incapable
idiot!”</p>

<p>“But you can turn your hand to something.”</p>

<p>“I can ride to hounds, and manage a boat, I’m a
bit of a carpenter, I can photograph, and I know
something of machinery.”</p>

<p>“There’s not a penny in any of them for you,”
declared the old man brusquely; “you’re a <i lang="fr">hamateur</i>.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking if I took up a small farm, sir, I
might——”</p>

<p>“Put it out of your ’ead,” brusquely interrupted
Mr. Pottinger; “and now I’ve been thinking, and
it comes to this. Of course I <i>could</i> say you and
Nancy was never to see one another again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you could say it,” rejoined the other significantly.</p>

<p>“Nancy will never go against me; if she did——”
Here he nodded his head with alarming significance.</p>

<p>“Have you any suggestion to make, sir? You
seemed to have some proposition.”</p>

<p>“I ’ave—it’s this. Suppose you go off for three
years wherever you like—it must be out of Great
Britain—and you will not correspond with Nancy
more than every six months. You will go into the
world like a man, not like a dressed-up young nincompoop,
and make ten thousand pounds. When
you bring me that, I will put forty thousand to it and
give you Nancy.”</p>

<p>“My good sir!” gasped Jack Truman, standing
squarely before him. “You might as well ask me to
bring you back the moon! Ten thousand pounds—ten
<i>thousand</i> pounds!”</p>

<p>“Some men pick it up in Wall Street in one afternoon—some
make it by a stroke of the pen. Why!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
I’ve even been told—but I don’t believe it—that
women get as much as that for a novel!”</p>

<p>“All these are clever people—they have capital, or
brains, or both. I have neither one nor the other.”</p>

<p>“Oh ho! so you are going to cry off—and not take
up my challenge, eh?”</p>

<p>“If I thought I had the very smallest chance—of—winning,
you know I’d jump at it like a shot.”</p>

<p>“Well, take my advice, and jump,” said Mr. Pottinger,
rising with a mighty effort—he was a seventeen-stone
man. “I’ll give you two days to consider
it, and now you may be off, and talk it over with
Nancy. I like you, Jack, always did, you know; but
I’m not going to give my little girl to a fellow that
has not some stuff in him—that is not worth ’is salt.
Why, look at <i>me</i>! I made myself what I ham! No,
you just go and see if you can’t do something on the
same pattern,” and he blundered heavily out of the
library.</p>

<p>Nancy Pottinger was twenty, a pretty little dark-eyed
girl, animated and energetic, clever, resourceful,
and plucky.</p>

<p>“Such an idea, Jack!” she exclaimed. “The
three years are horrible to contemplate, but imagine
father thinking of anything so romantic! Lately he
has been devouring old tales about knights sallying
forth in quest of adventures, and returning, after
many dangers, to their lady loves, to be crowned with
wreaths and glory. I’m positive daddy got his idea
from ‘Sir Baldwin’s Quest.’ I saw him reading it,
the last month; he reads very slowly and digests
every word. It has given him an <i>idea</i>, and he will
stick to it. When he grasps an idea, he never lets it
go. And if I were to run away with you, and marry
you, and live with you on sixpence a week, he would
be sorry for us, but he would never help us—never.
He is like that—he would die of a broken heart, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
leave all his money to charities! Now let us get a
map, and see where you can go and make your—and
my—fortune.”</p>

<p>“At best, I’m such a duffer,” he groaned.</p>

<p>“Not at all; you want self-confidence. You can
do lots of things perfectly. You can mend a watch,
or a bicycle, and doctor dogs.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I can do lots of odds and ends; I’m what
you may call Jack-of-all-trades, and master of none!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, I consider you most capable; especially
with your hands. Now let us go over the map,
and discuss your future field. America—well, they
are so very clever over there themselves, no use trying
that! India—no—mother’s uncle was there forty
years, and only brought home some elephant tusks!
Australia—too far from <i>me</i>. South Africa—the gold
and diamond mines, there you are!”</p>

<p>And South Africa it was! For more than two years
Jack Truman strove hard to accomplish his task. He
saw many different phases of life, and if he had not
gained a fortune, he had acquired experience, self-confidence,
and a splendid physique. He had, of
course, visited the Kimberley mines, been a barman
in Johannesburg, and, in the intervals of dire poverty,
tutor on a Dutch farm, and driver of an electric tram;
but he resolutely set his face against work on the
railway, or in the police, “steady regular employment
open to respectable young men.” No, he
wanted no permanent billet, he was looking for a big
coup—and the big coup invariably eluded him. For
instance, he purchased with all his savings a fine
stone from a simple-looking Kaffir boy, and the
splendid diamond proved to be pure <i>glass</i>. His next
accumulation he gambled and lost; he caught enteric,
and was laid up at Durban for three months. From
Durban, he somehow drifted to Zanzibar, from Zanzibar
to Suakim, and now despair began to lay hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
of him, for but four months longer remained, and
although he had toiled, and striven his utmost, he
was no nearer that great prize than when he started.
In Suakim he happened to encounter a naval officer—an
old schoolfellow—to whom he imparted his
story, and who listened with open-mouthed interest.</p>

<p>“Sounds like an Arabian Night’s tale!” he exclaimed,
“but I say, old chap, I believe I could put
you on to a good thing. If it comes off—I’ll be your
best man.”</p>

<p>“You will be the best man I’ve ever met, if you
put me on to that good job. I don’t care what it is.”</p>

<p>“Then listen. I know you don’t mind roughing
it, and have got a level head, are a fair shot with a
revolver, and don’t drink.”</p>

<p>“No; get along, Bobby.”</p>

<p>“You may have heard of the wreck of the <i>Mangalore</i>
passenger steamer in the Red Sea?”</p>

<p>“Not I.”</p>

<p>“It only happened a month ago. She was bound
from Marseilles to Singapore, and ran on something
about seventy miles below here—and lies a total
wreck.”</p>

<p>Jack nodded his head.</p>

<p>“She was a fine boat, eight thousand tons, carried
three hundred passengers, and was heavily insured at
Lloyd’s. The insurance is not paid yet; the underwriters
want a few more particulars before they hand
over £200,000—you see, it is a fairly stiff sum! She
lies five miles off the coast, well away from the steamer
track, and was out of her course. The captain talks
of fog, and currents—and everyone knows the Red
Sea is the very devil! I believe the rocks <i>grow</i>!
The office people here, I happen to know, are looking
for a trustworthy chap to carry on for a few weeks,
whilst things are straightened out a bit; a man to keep
off the Arab cut-throats, and have an eye to everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
till she is formally taken over: you see, there
is a lot of stores and liquor on board. They want a
steady level-headed <i>gentleman</i>, who can turn his hand
to most things, from a boat to a windlass; he is not
picked up easily on this coast! Now, suppose you
lend a hand, and go in for the berth; they will send
you down in the steam-launch with a couple of
Lascars, and pay you handsomely. I believe there is
money in it besides—perhaps a big haul.”</p>

<p>“And that’s just what I am in search of, these two
years, so I’m your man,” announced Jack with
emphasis.</p>

<p>“Mind you, it is not a kid-glove job; you run a
good many risks, both from the Arabs, and others.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind that; nothing venture, nothing
have. Can you give me a hint of the whereabouts of
the coin?”</p>

<p>“No—not exactly; it would be libellous. However,
unless you are a regular thickhead, you will
soon see how the land lies, and if you do find out anything
strange, communicate with Suakim at once.”</p>

<p>“And if I find nothing but stale stores, and rats?”</p>

<p>“You must risk that, and take your chance; it is
just a bit of a gamble, but mind you, I’ve given you
what you are hunting for all over the place, and that
is, a straight tip.”</p>

<p>Three days later found Jack Truman <i lang="fr">en route</i> to
the <i>Mangalore</i>; he had received information and
orders from headquarters, was to await full instructions
from London, and to keep watch over the
wreck—for possibly four weeks, or longer. The new
commander was despatched to his berth in a little
steam-launch, accompanied by two Lascars, and had
provided himself with plenty of tobacco, a Martini
rifle, revolver, screwdriver, pincers, matches, and a
change of clothes. After some hours’ steady steaming,
the <i>Mangalore</i> came into sight. She lay over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
at an angle of thirty degrees, with her decks awash,
and sleepy seas breaking over them.</p>

<p>Her position was undoubtedly precarious, and she
was anything but an inviting abode—in short, she
was a water-logged wreck. Far away from the <i>Mangalore</i>
lay the African coast, with a fringe of jagged
hills behind which the crimson sun was setting;
prominent among the hills, was one almost like a
tower, but no tower—or even hut—was on that desolate
shore.</p>

<p>When the two Lascars had come aboard, and beheld
the condition of the <i>Mangalore</i>, they loudly refused
to remain. She would go to pieces with the
first gale—yes, but not with <i>them</i> as her crew; and in
spite of every denunciation and expostulation that the
captain of the launch could devise—backed up by
Truman, with broken Arabic and forcible gestures—the
two cowards deserted the ship, and returned to
Suakim.</p>

<p>Previous to taking over charge, Jack Truman had
gleaned some particulars of the wreck. She had
gone aground most unexpectedly, when the passengers
were all at lunch; there was no panic, everything
had been managed with the utmost pluck and
coolness. The weather was calm, and passengers
had gone off comfortably in boats, had landed about
four o’clock in the afternoon, and been subsequently
transported on to Suakim. The level-headed captain
carried away his log-book, chronometer, and most of
his possessions in the steam-launch, and had been
warmly applauded for his courage, and resource.</p>

<p>Jack accepted the desertion of the Lascars with surprising
<i lang="fr">sangfroid</i>; he was accustomed to being alone.
This, however, was a new kind of solitude—a solitude
at sea. He scrambled about the deck, and explored
the abandoned steamer from end to end. There was
the long saloon, the smashed crockery, the passengers’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
cabins, with their clothes and belongings
scattered about, precisely as they had abandoned
them. He discovered quantities of stores, and quantities
of rats, and as the result of a careful inspection,
he decided to take up his quarters in the captain’s
cabin. Here, he made up a bed, and after a light
supper, turned in.</p>

<p>In a day or two the caretaker became accustomed to
his novel position; he smoked a good deal, he read
novels—the property of the late passengers—he sat
and stared for hours at the sea, or jagged coast-line,
and some distant rocky islands, but he never once saw
smoke or sail. His sole companion was the ship’s
cat, a bony, lean, uncanny looking animal, with the
pointed face peculiar to the Eastern feline. Sometimes
at night, listening to the wash of the waves,
it had seemed to Jack that the grey Grimalkin was
not his sole ship-mate, unless his imagination was
playing tricks. He seemed to hear a footstep, a
heavy and yet a stealthy footstep. The experience
was distinctly unpleasant, as he knew perfectly well
that there was not a human being but himself within
many miles. Jack did not believe in ghosts, and yet
when alone, as he was, even a strong man may succumb
to superstition. Solitude and silence evoke
strange thoughts. He had overhauled the entire
ship, and even examined the cargo; to his surprise, it
proved to consist of boxes full of scrap-iron; this at
once raised his suspicions—scrap-iron, at eighteen
shillings a ton, was not worth its carriage all the way
to Singapore! Then he made another strange discovery—he
was wonderfully agile in getting about,
even when he had to crawl and creep; down in the
hold were three great holes in the ship’s side, caused
by dynamite exploded from within! This was
astounding. Did it mean that the captain had deliberately
scuttled the <i>Mangalore</i>? Now if he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
but find a scrap of writing as clue, or a witness! If
he could but prove that the steamer had been purposely
cast away, his future was made! He would
inform the underwriters, save them an enormous loss,
and possibly secure a generous reward—say £10,000.</p>

<p>With such an incentive, Jack worked ceaselessly.
He searched almost day and night, anxious to discover
some clue before he was relieved, or the derelict
went to pieces, and he was compelled to abandon her,
and take to the boat. He believed he might find the
desired object in the captain’s cabin, and every day
he examined it. Every day he turned out the bunk,
the drawers, the desk; he lifted the carpet—but all
proved useless.</p>

<p>The cat and the caretaker had become close friends;
she accorded him her society; twice a day he gave her
some tinned milk in a saucer (for himself, he lived on
the stores), and she in return showed her gratitude by
occasionally bringing him a dead rat. The ship was
alive with them; what they existed on was a mystery;
but they overran the saloon, the lower deck, and
swarmed up the rigging. Truman often shot them
with his revolver—practice, to keep his eye in!</p>

<p>One hot, airless afternoon he was lying in his bunk
trying to sleep, when suddenly he was disturbed by
an extraordinary commotion behind the wainscot; a
violent scuffling and scratching. The enterprising
cat had evidently got in there, and could not find her
way out. He had missed her, the whole day. So
that was where she was! He called, and she began
to mew piteously and continuously. Well, there was
nothing for it but to break in the panel, which he proceeded
to do, with a series of violent kicks. Presently,
as a result, the cat crawled forth, looking extremely
dusty and dejected, and as she emerged from the
woodwork, a little ball of white paper rolled out after
her. Jack Truman stooped and picked it up and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
examined it curiously. Was it a find? It <i>was</i>! He
discovered a creased plan of the ship, on which were
three crosses in red ink, indicating the exact spot at
which the dynamite was placed, and there was also a
scrap of a letter evidently addressed to the captain.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Off coast. Lat. ... can’t miss it ... tower rock
... it daytime ... wire as arrang....”</p>
</div>

<p>So there was his fortune at last, thanks to the cat!
he had found the clue, and the whole thread was complete!
For some time he sat on the side of his bunk,
with the paper still in his hand, revelling in an ecstasy
of exaltation. The two morsels of dusty paper might
bring him Nancy. What should he set about first?
He must be cool, and collected, and not act hastily.
It was full moon, and the sea was smooth as oil; after
sundown he would get the boat, row ashore, and walk
during the night to a little station thirty miles up the
coast, and from there despatch a runner, or a camel
man, to Suakim. Meanwhile he would be compelled
to leave the cat in temporary charge of the <i>Mangalore</i>!</p>

<p>Talking of full moon, what was this enormous
shadow on the sky-light? He looked up, and was
confronted by a pair of watery grey eyes, and a large
crimson face. In another moment the face was
thrust into the cabin and a tall bare-footed man in
blue shirt and trousers said hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Hullo, boss, so you have found something!” and
he grinned, and pointed to the paper, and the broken
boards. “I’ve had my eye on you! I always
guessed this was a put-up job, and a mighty neat one
too.”</p>

<p>“Who the devil are you?” demanded Jack, sliding
off the bunk, and rising to his feet.</p>

<p>“Your gen’leman companion,” folding his bare
arms. “I am Joe Todd—one of the crew; I was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
bit ‘on’ when she struck, and in my berth; the boats
forgot me in the scramble. I declare, when I woke,
and found what had happened, I thought I was
dreaming; however, I have been pretty comfortable—the
best of liquor free, and I have not wasted my
opportunities—a bottle of French brandy and a
couple of fizz a day, eh? What beats me is having
no baccy. The smell of yours drove me nigh crazy!
So here I am—and in the nick of time!”</p>

<p>“Why did you not show before? Where do you
stow yourself?”</p>

<p>“Aye, that’s telling! I suppose you’re in charge
of the liquor—eh? The old Hooker has some of the
best; I would have lain doggo still, but for the baccy—it
drew me out, that pipe of yourn. What’s this?”
suddenly making a snatch at the papers.</p>

<p>“Only a plan of the ship,” replied Truman, keeping
his fury under control.</p>

<p>“Aye, and the three marks are where she is sunk.
Oh, <i>I</i> have been poking round too. I say, boss, this
<i>will</i> be a plum for the insurance people! You and I,
go shares!”</p>

<p>“No you don’t!” cried Jack, making a dash to
recapture his prize, but the other was too quick for
him; and now began within the limited space of that
small cabin a most desperate struggle between the
two men. Round and round, and up and down, and
to and fro they wrestled.—The cat, in alarm, took
refuge in a little rack.—Jack was as hard as an open-air
life, youth, temperance, and exercise could make
him. The sailor’s was a bigger, heavier, more
powerful frame—and he was half mad with brandy.</p>

<p>The chances were five to one that Jack would tire
down his opponent, when his foot slipped, and he fell
on the back of his head, with the sailor a-top of him.</p>

<p>The fall stunned him, and when he came to his
senses he was lying on the floor, the contents of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
cabin were scattered in all directions, and it was
empty. He lay for some time endeavouring to re-arrange
his ideas. He recalled the sailor, the
struggle, and the fact that he had gone off with the
clue in his possession. He rose, and with difficulty
staggered to the door; it was locked on the outside.</p>

<p>Jack’s frenzy at having the cup of attainment
snatched from his lips, his bitter disappointment, and
his bad fall, combined to throw him into a fever. He
lay half delirious all that night; with morning, he recovered,
rose, and endeavoured to burst open the
door; no use—it was strong and held fast; he could
not blow off the lock, for his revolver was in the
saloon. Parched with thirst, he emptied the water
jug, which he had luckily replenished at night-fall.
The sympathetic cat crept into the port-hole; later she
returned bringing him a rat. A horrible idea came
to him. Was it possible that he might yet be compelled
to exist upon the cat’s bounty? No, no—he
had not come to that; but by the second afternoon—after
thirty-six hours’ imprisonment—he was nearly
mad with hunger and thirst—especially thirst.</p>

<p>The moon rose; he stood with his face to the port-hole
endeavouring to catch a breath of air, yet what
was the good of prolonging the agony, since die he
must? Hours passed, and then, as he stood, he
seemed to hear a distant sound, not the lazy plash of
the water, or the boisterous singing of the drunkard,
but a far-away humming and throbbing—it was the
steam-launch!</p>

<p>Yes, nearer and nearer it approached. His heart
beat as if it would choke him. He trembled so
violently, he could hardly stand. Now he could hear
voices, and he shouted with all his remaining
strength. After what seemed a whole week of waiting,
he heard steps coming down the companion; the
door was flung open, he was free. Here were two or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
three officers and officials, who were come to relieve
him; they were amazed indeed to discover Truman
locked into a cabin, and looking death-like, with staring
hollow eyes, and parched, cracked lips. What
had happened?</p>

<p>He pointed to his mouth, and whispered ‘<i>water</i>.’
Water and a stimulant brought him to himself; in a
short time the little crowd was in possession of his
story. He indicated the broken panel, and showed
them where the precious papers had been concealed.</p>

<p>“Now we will go and find the ruffian,” said the
principal official; “we must tackle him quickly, and
not let him have a chance to make away with his
prize.”</p>

<p>The sailor was easily discovered—his resounding
snores betrayed him; he lay extended at full length
on a sofa in the saloon, fast asleep, with an empty
bottle beside him. His sleep was a stupor so profound
that he had not heard the launch arrive, and
he never stirred, whilst careful fingers removed two
pieces of much damaged paper from his filthy trouser
pocket.</p>

<p>Finally, when they roused him unceremoniously,
he sat up, stared, and exclaimed, “Bless us if this
b’ain’t another blooming dream!” Subsequently he
admitted that “he had forgotten the other cove; he
had not been, so to say, sober since he saw him, and
fought him for a greedy swab—well, it might be a
day ago—it might be two or three.”</p>

<p>The upshot of the business was, that Jack Truman,
the sailor Joe Todd, and the ship’s cat were taken off
the wreck, and brought to Suakim; here the papers
were examined, and sworn to, telegraph wires put
into requisition, and lawyers consulted. The underwriters
proved the fraudulent casting-away of the S.S.
<i>Mangalore</i> (but her clever captain had already made
his escape to South America). Subsequently the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
wreck was sold to a firm of merchants in Suez, who
disposed of her piecemeal. The saloon furniture now
embellishes one of the smartest cafés in the town—who
sits, may see.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, Jack Truman received a substantial
cheque, which he immediately carried home,
and laid before Boaz Pottinger, who gave him,
according to his promise, £40,000, and the hand of
his daughter Nancy.</p>

HELEN, OR SEMIRAMIS?</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Julian Serle</span> never intended to marry,
and up to the age of forty-five clung bravely to this
resolve. He was a well-known authority on Assyria,
had written successful books, read impressive papers,
and was precisely at that point in his career when
much was expected of him. His mode of life fluctuated
between periods of incessant and engrossing
labour, and spells of “butterflying” in smart society.</p>

<p>The Professor was well off, and a world-wide
traveller. When in London he occupied comfortable
chambers in Whitehall Court, and was a member of
the Athenæum and other clubs. Returning from
Egypt, where he had spent the winter—working on
an important book—he, so to speak, fell! Among
the crowd of Anglo-Indians on board the steamer
which he joined at Port Said, was Miss Helen
Thursby, a popular girl among her fellow-passengers,
handsome, lively, good-natured, and accomplished.
She played accompaniments, amused children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
interested their mothers, and fascinated men, both
young and old.</p>

<p>Their charming new acquaintance made no secret
of the fact that for the last two years she had been a
governess in Simla, and was now returning to England,
before joining her only near relative, a married
brother in Canada.</p>

<p>The Professor, although hardened by many London
seasons, was immensely attracted by the young lady’s
bright eyes, her sympathetic manner and light-hearted
gaiety. Together they played chess and
bridge, and together they promenaded the decks,
whilst complacent matrons looked on and approved.
Julian Serle was a celebrity, a well-bred, good-looking
little man, with, it was said, considerable private
means.</p>

<p>“It would be a capital match for the girl. Much
better for her to marry and settle in London than to
rough it on a ranch in Canada.”</p>

<p>Ultimately, a moonlit Mediterranean night proved
to be the undoing of Julian. As he smoked, and
paced the deck alone, he had been meditating on Miss
Thursby. What an agreeable companion Helen
would be! So intelligent, sensible, charming. He
had no near relations, merely a hungry, extravagant
nephew, his heir. Why not marry and make himself
a home, before he fell into the sere and yellow?
Miss Thursby was clever; she would be a stimulating
helpmate—one who could type and copy, and was
interested in Assyria. Yes! Helen would be his
Egeria, and his inspiration.</p>

<p>That same lovely night, leaning over the bulwarks,
he spoke; deplored his lonely life, his lack of belongings,
and figuratively laid himself and his fortune at
his lady’s remarkably neat feet.</p>

<p>“I am not,” he pleaded, “the usual style of musty
fossilised old professor; we will enjoy life together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
and when I am working you can still have your own
friends and amusements. And I think I can promise
that you shall never be bored.”</p>

<p>His lady-love listened to him with shining eyes,
and accepted his proposal with joy. Perhaps the
little man beside her was not precisely her ideal. Her
ideal had been someone in India, who was too poor
to marry a penniless girl, and had subsequently taken
a well-dowered wife. However, she had completely
recovered from that heart attack, and honestly liked
her present suitor.</p>

<p>Six weeks after the steamer had docked at Tilbury,
the pair were married in London, and subsequently
established themselves in a nice roomy flat in South
Kensington.</p>

<p>All their friends crowded to call. The bride, though
poor, was well connected, the bridegroom a popular
celebrity, and the newly-married couple lived in a
perpetual round of dinners and social entertainment.
Serle had a large circle of distinguished contemporaries:
philosophers, men of letters, and men of
affairs.</p>

<p>This agreeable condition continued for months.
Helen Serle was so hospitable and attractive that visitors
invaded the flat from morning to night. She
was invited to theatres, concerts, lectures, and dances,
yet never neglected her home or husband, but wrote
and typed industriously—that is to say, when Julian
had a working fit—and found ample leisure for music,
theatres, and other pleasures.</p>

<p>The Professor had at first joined <i lang="it">con amore</i> in the
social whirl—he was a man who did nothing by
halves. Lately he had been seized by a feverish inspiration,
and was engrossed in a book, “The Life
of Semiramis,” on which he had worked fitfully for
years, in the hope that it would be his <i lang="la">magnum opus</i>.
Resolved to secure leisure, he turned his back upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
London, let the flat for six months, and retired to
Brighton. But here his fate was no better! Helen
had such a faculty for picking up acquaintances and
coming across friends, that his precious time was
broken into for hours and days and weeks!</p>

<p>From Brighton he fled to the Athens of the North.
Here, alas, matters were worse, for literary society
fell upon the author, so to speak, as one man!
Dinners, from which he could not absent himself,
were given in his honour. He was invited to read
papers, and to lecture on his most notable subjects—“Sardinapolis,”
and “Alexander the Great in
Assyria.”</p>

<p>In short, his work was absolutely at a standstill.
Summer was coming, but “The Life of Semiramis,”
and her reign of forty-two years, was not advancing
to any appreciable degree. Strong measures were
his only resource. And in response to an advertisement,
he secured a temporary home in a far-distant
village in the south of England. It was off a main
line, and buried in the country. Servants, dog,
poultry, and pony were included with a most delightful
furnished cottage. Helen Serle was enchanted.
Edinburgh was a little bit too literary for her; she
enjoyed the change from the thunder of trams in
Princes Street to the cooing of pigeons in the woods,
and fell in love at first sight with the cottage, the
garden, and the village. Alas, in a place whose
name he had never heard till he had rented “Meadow-sweet,”
the Professor encountered an acquaintance—Canon
Simpson, an old college friend, who happened
to be staying at the Rectory.</p>

<p>“I say, fancy seeing <i>you</i> here, Serle!” he exclaimed,
as he held out an eager hand. “I caught
sight of you in church; and when I told the Rector
who you were, he was most frightfully excited. He
and his wife hope to see a lot of you. You know he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
has been to the Holy Land, and to Nineveh. Everyone
for miles round is coming to call on Mrs. Serle.”</p>

<p>For the moment Mrs. Serle’s husband felt paralysed
and speechless. Like the dove from the ark, would
he never find a place for the sole of his foot? When
he thought of his book, his notes, his elaborate bits
of description, all clamouring to be copied out, and
polished up, he was struck with a brain storm.
“Desperate ills require desperate remedies.” If the
whole country was threatening to call, and the cottage
was to be overrun with visitors, there were precisely
two alternatives: one to return to Meadow-sweet,
and begin to pack—the other ... and the
other he seized on. Clenching his hand on his stick,
with his guilty eyes fastened on the ground, he jerked
out:</p>

<p>“Er—ah! Strictly between ourselves, my dear
old fellow, we don’t want any visitors; or rather visitors—er—are
not likely to want <i>us</i>! The lady who is
staying with me is——” Here the colour mounted to
his hair. “Well, I need say no more.” And with
a shrug of his shoulders, the celebrity turned away.</p>

<p>To do his conscience justice, Julian Serle felt
miserably hot and uncomfortable, as he faced towards
home; he had insinuated a most terrible lie—but there
was nothing else for it! He would allow the neighbours
to suppose that Helen was his mistress—since
no other defence would secure complete privacy and
isolation. After all, what did it matter in this God-forsaken
part of the world, where they did not know
a soul? And it was only for three months. Then
Helen could return home, meet all her old friends,
and as many new ones as she liked!</p>

<p>At first Mrs. Serle was supremely indifferent to the
lack of callers. In fact, she never gave them a
thought. The pony and trap, the dog, the garden
and the poultry, kept her delightfully engaged. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
had a weekly box from Mudie’s, some interesting
embroidery, plenty of correspondence, and half a
dozen new songs. After two or three weeks these
pleasures began to pall, and she realised the want of
a companion of her own sex, with whom to discuss
new stitches, new novels, and new songs. Julian,
plunged in the records of Semiramis and her times,
and surrounded by stacks of musty old books, had
no thought for anything but his absorbing work, and—as
an occasional relaxation—a little trout-fishing.</p>

<p>But, once Helen had seen to the housekeeping, the
flowers, and accomplished a certain amount of typing,
her hours were her own, and proved both empty and
solitary. As she walked out with the dog, or drove
“Fat Tom,” the bay pony, she noticed that the
neighbourhood was well populated. Within half a
mile were two large places, whose gates delivered and
received motors. There were also various country
houses, where she caught sight of green lawns, and
gatherings of active white-clad figures, playing
tennis. Helen Serle loved tennis, and was quite a
notable performer.</p>

<p>Strange that not a soul had come to look them up.
And yet they had been at Beckwell a whole month.
The villagers, too, seemed funny people. Their
manners were surly, their answers brief to rudeness.
And how they stared! (Perhaps her rather daring
French hats and very smart high-heeled shoes lent
some colour to her husband’s lie.) Mrs. Serle was
not unaccustomed to being looked at, nor did she
disdain a certain amount of respectful admiration, but
in the expression of these people’s eyes lay curiosity,
aversion, and contempt. The servants of the cottage—two
well-trained maids and a gardener-groom—had,
at first, been civil and satisfactory. Now they were
off-hand and almost insolent; and yet she treated
them well, and gave little trouble. Indeed, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
dusted the drawing-room and did the lamps herself,
partly to fill up her time. Nevertheless, the cook
scowled, Annie flounced and slammed doors, and
once she had been overpowered by a suspicion that
the groom-gardener had winked at her! She turned
and confronted him with a flaming face—and he had
never repeated this enormity.</p>

<p>Latterly Annie had been openly impertinent, and
one day when her mistress asked her what she meant
by saying, “Good enough for <i>you</i>!” with arms
akimbo, she replied, “Oh, you know what I mean
well enough, and only for Miss Mills and me bein’
with her so long, and my promisin’ I’d do my best,
I’d have been out of this the very day you come in.
Up to now I’ve always lived with respectable people,
and I’ve got my own character to think of. And
Jim—that’s my young man—says he don’t half like
it!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” cried Helen, white with
anger. “I insist on knowing!”</p>

<p>But Annie merely turned her back, and began to
arrange the ornaments on the chimney-piece.</p>

<p>“Answer me, Annie.”</p>

<p>“What’s the good of telling you what you <i>know</i>?”
said Annie over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“You cannot remain here!” said her mistress
breathlessly. “You must leave at once. Go now
and pack your things.”</p>

<p>“Only too glad to be out of it,” was Annie’s retort,
as with a toss of her head she tramped from the room.</p>

<p>Julian Serle was deep in meditation over the particular
neat insertion of a “purple patch,” when his
wife burst in upon him in a condition of extraordinary
excitement.</p>

<p>“Oh, Julian, what do you think! That girl Ann
has been most outrageously insolent. I found her
just now trying on my best hat; and when I remonstrated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
she said the most awful things—insinuating—I
can’t tell you what. I think she must be crazy,
for I’m sure she doesn’t drink. Anyhow, she shall
depart within the hour. So please give me one
pound, thirteen shillings, and four pence.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” he exclaimed. “Why mind
her, Nell? It’s only her ignorance. The mental
calibre of these rustics is abnormally low.”</p>

<p>“No, no, it’s <i>not</i> her ignorance!” retorted his
wife. “On the contrary, Annie implies that she
knows a great deal on some subject about <i>us</i>—but
what it is she refuses to divulge.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear, how will you manage without her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll get in the laundress’s sister. I hear
she’s been in service. Sooner than keep Annie, I
would do the work myself.”</p>

<p>That afternoon Annie departed. As she bounced
into the room to receive her wages, she said with a
touch of sarcasm:</p>

<p>“I’ll not trouble you for a character. A character
from this house would be no use to me—and only
stand in my way. I hear you are getting Maggie
King as parlourmaid—and when she comes there
will be a pair of you!”</p>

<p>Then, seizing the one pound, thirteen shillings,
and four pence, she swept out, to where a ruddy-faced
young man was waiting to carry her box. He
accorded Mrs. Serle a sort of up-and-down glare,
and was presumably the “Jim, who didn’t half like
it!”</p>

<p>After this little domestic storm, things subsided at
the cottage. Maggie King proved humble and
amenable, but her mistress noticed that she and the
cook were barely on speaking terms—and that
Maggie took her meals alone in the pantry.</p>

<p>One evening, as they sat in the garden after dinner,
Helen said to her husband:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“Julian, don’t you think it very odd that not a
soul has called?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, my dear; the fact is—they know who
I am, and that I’m desperately busy, and only here
for absolute peace and seclusion. They understand
how hard I am working.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, that’s all right. But what about
<i>me</i>? I’m not clamouring for a rush of callers, or
chatterers; but tea in the garden, and a game of
tennis, or even a walk with another woman would not
disturb you. Do you know that I’ve not spoken to
one of my sex for eight weeks? I really don’t want
to grumble, dear—but it’s rather dreary for me. And
I cannot understand why not even the parson’s wife
has called—though I’m a regular attendant at church.
I expect they’ve had an infectious disease in this
house—and that not very long ago. The neighbours
are afraid to come near us. What is your idea?”</p>

<p>“Um! Um!”—taking his cheroot out of his
mouth and looking at it thoughtfully. “Maybe so.
There may be something in what you say.”</p>

<p>Then he suddenly picked up the <i>Spectator</i>, and she
resumed her embroidery with a sigh. After a few
moments’ dead silence the author raised his eyes
cautiously over the paper, and gravely surveyed his
wife. The expression on his face was rather anxious
and doubtful. As Helen caught his eye, she said:</p>

<p>“How soon do you think the book will be
finished?” She had actually come to hate the great
work! Solitude, silence, and loneliness had quenched
her earlier enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“I am just commencing the last chapter but one.”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness!” she exclaimed with heartfelt
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I’m hoping that this work will definitely decide
my position as an authority on Assyrian matters, and
rank me with Blair, Usher, and Clinton. If so, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
labours will not have been in vain”; and he smiled
with easy assurance.</p>

<p>“But, Julian dear, do you think that it was worth
it?”</p>

<p>“Worth what?”</p>

<p>“I mean sacrificing hours, days, and months, to a
dusty, sandy old subject—that can only interest a
comparatively small public?”</p>

<p>He put down his paper and stared as if he could
not believe his ears.</p>

<p>“You miss so much,” she continued boldly.
“Think of the beautiful summer you have wasted,
stuffing indoors, from morning till night; only creeping
out now and then to do a little fishing. Think of
our friends, that we have scarcely seen for six months.
You are sacrificing your best hours and days to the
memory of a dead woman—a woman who has been
dead nearly four thousand years! Even so, I am
most frightfully jealous of her!”</p>

<p>“My dear girl, you’re talking the greatest nonsense!
I thoroughly appreciate the beauty of the
world. As for society, I have you—a host in yourself.
If I had not taken determined measures, and
buried myself here, this book of mine would <i>never</i>
have been finished.”</p>

<p>“But I thought you were almost at the last chapter?”
she protested, with tears in her voice.</p>

<p>“That’s true. But the complete work has to be
carefully revised—rather a big job! However, when
it is ready for the printers, you and I will go off, and
have a couple of gay weeks in Paris.”</p>

<p>The long, empty days lagged on. Mrs. Serle, as
she walked or gardened, felt more and more solitary
and depressed. Alas, for the time when she rode
high on the crest of popularity! She could not have
believed it possible that she would have pined so incessantly
for the society of one of her own sex. Was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
there something strange about the house they lived
in? Was there anything peculiar about herself?
Why did people cross the road when they saw her?
Why had she a whole pew to herself in church? The
situation presented was an extraordinary puzzle!
Yet she dared not seek further enlightenment from
Julian, for just now he was so immersed in his book
that he scarcely snatched his meals. Her enlightenment
came from another quarter.</p>

<p>For lack of amusement, it was her custom to drive
far afield, the dog seated beside her as sole companion.
In a remote country road she happened
upon a lady resting on a bank with a bicycle beside
her. She was evidently in distress, as she looked
ghastly pale, and had taken off a boot.</p>

<p>“Can I help you in any way?” inquired Mrs.
Serle, as she pulled up.</p>

<p>For a moment the stranger did not reply. Her
pale face became crimson. At last she said:</p>

<p>“I’ve had a tumble off my bicycle. We went over
a loose stone, and I’m afraid I’ve sprained my ankle.
If you can give me a lift back to Beckwell I shall be
awfully obliged.”</p>

<p>“Yes, with pleasure,” said Mrs. Serle. “The
pony will stand, and I will get out and help you.”</p>

<p>Within five minutes the stranger, her bicycle, and
the deposed dog were packed into the cart, and the
Good Samaritan drove off.</p>

<p>For a long time her companion confined her conversation
to monosyllables. Miss Piggott, the rector’s
sister-in-law, had no desire to talk to the pretty young
woman who shared the Professor’s address—but not
his name. Strange to say, she was <i>not</i> “made up”!</p>

<p>“I suppose you live at Beckwell?” enquired Mrs.
Serle.</p>

<p>“Yes, in the red house just as you come into the
village.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“It’s a pretty place, but extraordinarily dull. Do
you know, I have been here three months, and have
not spoken to a soul? I hope you won’t mind my
saying that the residents of Beckwell are not very
sociable to strangers.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose we’re not,” murmured the other,
who looked self-conscious, and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you how I am longing to depart, for I
feel as if I should soon grow into a potato! You see,
my husband is completely engrossed in his book—working
alone all day. As it’s rather an important
piece of literature, I never disturb him, and have
rather a lonely time. I cannot understand what I
have done to be ostracised!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Serle was allowing weeks of accumulated
bitterness to find an outlet at last!</p>

<p>“We have come to the conclusion that there must
have been smallpox or something in the house, and
that is the reason that no one has ever come near us.
Perhaps you can tell me if this is the case?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Miss Piggott, “there has never
been a case of smallpox in the village—as far as I
know. But I think if you ask Mr. Serle, <i>he</i> will explain
the reason why you have no visitors.”</p>

<p>“I have asked my husband.”</p>

<p>“Your <i>husband</i>!” interrupted the other, “your
<i>husband</i>!”</p>

<p>“Certainly my husband. What else did you think
he was?” And she pulled up the pony, and surveyed
her companion with blazing eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is most embarrassing!” bleated Miss
Piggott. “That <i>I</i> should be called upon to explain
matters is too—too—bad!” and her face exhibited
bright red patches on its high cheek-bones. Never in
a life of fifty years had she found herself in such a
desperate situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“But please do enlighten me,” urged Mrs. Serle.
“I shall be so grateful to you if you will.”</p>

<p>“Well then—I suppose—I <i>must</i>! A few days
after you arrived here, Canon Simpson met Mr. Serle
in the village. It seems they were old college friends,
and when the Canon told your—er—husband, that we
were all so pleased to have him amongst us, and were
hoping to make your acquaintance, he gave the
Canon to understand that—you were—er—not his
<i>wife</i>!”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Mrs. Serle, and her voice was so
loud and shrill that it startled the dog and pony.</p>

<p>“At any rate, that is what he <i>implied</i>, and wished
to imply!”</p>

<p>“But I am his wife! We were married at St.
Mary Abbotts, Kensington, a year ago; and there
were nearly three hundred people at our wedding.”</p>

<p>“Then what did he <i>mean</i>?”</p>

<p>“I think I can explain,” she said, suddenly whipping
up Fat Tom. “He wanted absolute solitude
and leisure in order to finish his book. We left our
flat in London for Brighton; but there we seemed to
have as many friends as ever—people, especially my
women pals, running in and out all day. We went
to Edinburgh, and there the literary world lionised
him. At last, when in despair, he saw an advertisement
of Beckwell, and we moved here. When Canon
Simpson accosted him, and told him that all the
neighbourhood was coming to call, I expect he felt
desperate, and just closed the door with my good
name! Oh yes, I see everything so plainly now.
Why people look over my head, and cross the street!
Why Annie was insolent. Why I was not invited to
help at the bazaar; and why young men kiss their
hands to me! I understand why my husband was
anxious to turn the conversation when I complained
of being dull; and was so full of excuses for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
neighbours. He holds my reputation at a lower
price than his book. Well—we shall see about
that!”</p>

<p>“I think he has behaved disgracefully, in a most
shocking manner,” burst out her companion, “and
I’m not at all surprised that you are upset.”</p>

<p>“Upset!” repeated the other, with an hysterical
laugh. “I shall not be as much ‘upset’ as Julian,
when we have squared up accounts.</p>

<p>“Well, here we are. I think this is your house.”
She drew up as she spoke, helped the lady to descend,
and lifted out the bicycle. “I am immensely obliged
to you,” she said, cutting short the other’s voluble
thanks; “if <i>I</i> have given you a lift—<i>you</i> have opened
my eyes.”</p>

<p>Then, without another word, she got into the cart
and drove away.</p>

<p>All that evening Helen was strangely white and
silent; she complained of having a violent headache,
and soon retired.</p>

<p>The Professor, unaware of the Sword of Damocles
that was suspended above his head, started early next
morning for London, in order to have an interview
with his publisher. When he returned it was nine
o’clock at night, and an appetising little supper
awaited him. As soon as it was concluded he withdrew
as usual into the study. The fire was out. The
grate was full of ashes and scraps of paper—it looked
as if a large bundle of manuscripts had recently been
burnt!</p>

<p>“Hullo, Nellie,” he called to her. “Someone has
been having a bonfire in here!”</p>

<p>She entered, closed the door carefully behind her,
and set her back against it. “<i>Who</i> do you think?
What do you suppose it is that has been burnt?” she
asked. Her face looked rigid and strained as she
confronted him. “Yesterday I discovered why no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
one came near me. Julian, you have been guilty of
the basest and most dishonourable conduct. In order
to enjoy complete isolation, I have been humiliated
before the world, my reputation has been sacrificed to
the book. My good name has counted as nothing, in
comparison with Semiramis!” She put her hand to
her throat, and swallowed. “I shall send a copy of
our marriage certificate to the parson, and request
him to publish the truth.”</p>

<p>“So this is your revenge!” cried the Professor,
who was trembling from head to foot. “For what
was a mere ruse, to keep people at bay, and prevent
tribes of women swarming in and out all day long,
and disturbing me with their damned giggling, and
shrill, high voices. Another wife would have thrown
herself heart and soul into her husband’s task—instead
of being <i>jealous</i> of his labour. This book,
which you have burnt, meant everything to me. I
have had the subject in my mind ever since I was a
lad at Oxford. Now it is all gone,” and his face
quivered with emotion, “my toil, my notes, that I
have been collecting for years!” He completely
broke down as he added, “It is as if you had murdered
my child.”</p>

<p>“You should never have married me,” she
answered, wholly unmoved; “and I will now leave
you to replace Semiramis with some other monumental
work. I have cabled to my brother, and taken
my passage in the Empress line for Quebec. This is
good-bye.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” he groaned, as he sank into a chair,
and bowed his head in his hands. “So be it—so be
it!”</p>

<p>But matters were not altogether as desperate as the
Professor had been led to believe. The day before
she left England Mrs. Serle posted to her husband
the priceless manuscript that she had merely pretended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
to destroy, and his relief and joy were naturally
beyond description.</p>

<p>Before Julian Serle abandoned Beckwell—which he
did almost immediately—in figurative sackcloth and
ashes, he went and confessed himself to the parson,
and received the severe admonition which he most
undoubtedly deserved. Subsequently the guilty man
returned to his flat in London—to a home which was
empty, not to say desolate. He was miserably unhappy,
and missed his wife at every turn; her friends,
yes, and his own, were full of insistent and embarrassing
enquiries, to which he replied with a very halting
tale about Helen having received a sudden and imperative
summons to Montreal. Her absence weighed
upon him heavily; after all, a live Helen was ten times
more to him than a long-defunct Semiramis! So
leaving his precious book to see itself through the
press, he took ship for Canada, where he sought out
his outraged consort, abased himself appropriately—and
received a full pardon.</p>

THE RED BUNGALOW</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a considerable time since my husband’s regiment
(“The Snapshots”) was stationed in Kulu, yet it
seems as if it were but yesterday, when I look back
on the days we spent in India. As I sit by the fire,
or in the sunny corner of the garden, sometimes when
my eyes are dim with reading I close them upon the
outer world, and see, with vivid distinctness, events
which happened years ago. Among various mental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
pictures, there is not one which stands forth with the
same weird and lurid effect as the episode of “The
Red Bungalow.”</p>

<p>Robert was commanding his regiment, and we
were established in a pretty spacious house at Kulu,
and liked the station. It was a little off the beaten
track, healthy and sociable. Memories of John Company
and traces of ancient Empires still clung to the
neighbourhood. Pig-sticking and rose-growing,
Badminton and polo, helped the resident of the
place to dispose of the long, long Indian day—never
too long for me!</p>

<p>One morning I experienced an agreeable surprise,
when, in reading the Gazette, I saw that my cousin,
Tom Fellowes, had been appointed Quartermaster-General
of the district, and was to take up the billet
at once.</p>

<p>Tom had a wife and two dear little children (our
nursery was empty), and as soon as I had put down
the paper I wired to Netta to congratulate and beg
them to come to us immediately. Indian moves are
rapid. Within a week our small party had increased
to six, Tom, Netta, little Guy, aged four, and Baba,
a dark-eyed coquette of nearly two. They also
brought with them an invaluable ayah—a Madrassi.
She spoke English with a pretty foreign accent, and
was entirely devoted to the children.</p>

<p>Netta was a slight young woman with brilliant
eyes, jet-black hair, and a firm mouth. She was
lively, clever, and a capital helpmate for an army
man, with marvellous energy, and enviable taste.</p>

<p>Tom, an easy-going individual in private life, was
a red-hot soldier. All financial and domestic affairs
were left in the hands of his wife, and she managed
him and them with conspicuous success.</p>

<p>Before Netta had been with us three days she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
began, in spite of my protestations, to clamour about
“getting a house.”</p>

<p>“Why, you have only just arrived,” I remonstrated.
“You are not even half unpacked. Wait
here a few weeks, and make acquaintance with the
place and people. It is such a pleasure to me to have
you and the children.”</p>

<p>“You spoil them—especially Guy!” she answered
with a laugh. “The sooner they are removed the
better, and, seriously, I want to settle in. I am longing
to do up my new house, and make it pretty, and
have a garden—a humble imitation of yours—a Badminton
court, and a couple of ponies. I’m like a
child looking forward to a new toy, for, cooped up in
Fort William in Calcutta, I never felt that I had a
real home.”</p>

<p>“Even so,” I answered, “there is plenty of time,
and I think you might remain here till after Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Christmas!” she screamed. “I shall be having
Christmas parties myself, and a tree for the kids; and
you, dear Liz, shall come and help me. I want to
get into a house next week.”</p>

<p>“Then pray don’t look to me for any assistance.
If you make such a hasty exit the station will think
we have quarrelled.”</p>

<p>“The station could not be so detestable, and no
one could quarrel with <i>you</i>, you dear old thing,” and
as she stooped down and patted my cheek, I realised
that she was fully resolved to have her own way.</p>

<p>“I have yards and yards of the most lovely
cretonne for cushions, and chairs, and curtains,” she
continued, “brought out from home, and never yet
made up. Your Dirzee is bringing me two men to-morrow.
When I was out riding this morning, I
went to an auction-room—John Mahomed, they call
the man—and inspected some sofas and chairs. Do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
let us drive there this afternoon on our way to the
club, and I also wish to have a look round. I hear
that nearly all the good bungalows are occupied.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are,” I answered triumphantly. “At
present there is not <i>one</i> in the place to suit you! I
have been running over them with my mind’s eye,
and either they are near the river, or too small, or—not
healthy. After Christmas the Watsons are going
home; there will be their bungalow—it is nice and
large, and has a capital office, which would suit
Tom.”</p>

<p>We drove down to John Mahomed’s that afternoon,
and selected some furniture—Netta exhibiting her
usual taste and business capacity. On our way to
the club I pointed out several vacant houses, and,
among them, the Watsons’ charming abode—with its
celebrated gardens, beds of brilliant green lucerne,
and verandah curtained in yellow roses.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” she admitted, “it is a fine, roomy sort
of abode, but I hate a thatched roof—I want one with
tiles—red tiles. They make such a nice bit of colour
among trees.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you won’t find many tiled roofs in
Kulu,” I answered; “this will limit you a good
deal.”</p>

<p>For several mornings, together, we explored bungalows—and
I was by no means sorry to find that, in
the eyes of Netta, they were all more or less found
wanting—too small, too damp, too near the river, too
stuffy—and I had made up my mind that the
Watsons’ residence (despite its thatch) was to be
Netta’s fate, when one afternoon she hurried in, a
little breathless and dusty, and announced, with a
wild wave of her sunshade, “I’ve found it!”</p>

<p>“Where? Do you mean a house?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes. What moles we’ve been! At the back of
this, down the next turn, at the cross roads! Most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
central and suitable. They call it the Red Bungalow.”</p>

<p>“The Red Bungalow,” I repeated reflectively. I
had never cast a thought to it—what is always before
one is frequently unnoticed. Also it had been unoccupied
ever since we had come to the station, and
as entirely overlooked as if it had no existence! I
had a sort of recollection that there was some drawback—it
was either too large, or too expensive, or too
out of repair.</p>

<p>“It is strange that I never mentioned it,” I said.
“But it has had no tenant for years.”</p>

<p>“Unless I am greatly mistaken, it will have one
before long,” rejoined Netta, with her most definite
air. “It looks as if it were just waiting for us—and
had been marked ‘reserved.’”</p>

<p>“Then you have been over it?”</p>

<p>“No, I could not get in, the doors are all bolted,
and there seems to be no chokedar. I wandered
round the verandahs, and took stock of the size and
proportions—it stands in an imposing compound.
There are the ruins at the back, mixed up with the
remains of a garden—old guava trees, lemon trees,
a vine, and a well. There is a capital place at one
side for two Badminton courts, and I have mentally
laid out a rose-garden in front of the portico.”</p>

<p>“How quickly your mind travels!”</p>

<p>“Everything <i>must</i> travel quickly in these days,”
she retorted. “We all have to put on the pace. Just
as I was leaving, I met a venerable coolie person, who
informed me that John Mahomed had the keys, so I
despatched him to bring them at once, and promised
a rupee for his trouble. Now do, like a good soul,
let us have tea, and start off immediately after to
inspect my treasure-trove!”</p>

<p>“I can promise you a cup of tea in five minutes,” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
replied, “but I am not so certain of your treasure-trove.”</p>

<p>“I am. I generally can tell what suits me at first
sight. The only thing I am afraid of is the rent.
Still, in Tommy’s position one must not consider
that. He is obliged to live in a suitable style.”</p>

<p>“The Watsons’ house has often had a staff-tenant.
I believe it would answer all your requirements.”</p>

<p>“Too near the road, and too near the <i>General</i>,”
she objected, with a gesture of impatience. “Ah,
here comes tea at last!”</p>

<p>It came, but before I had time to swallow my second
cup, I found myself hustled out of the house by my
energetic cousin and <i lang="fr">en route</i> to her wonderful discovery—the
Red Bungalow.</p>

<p>We had but a short distance to walk, and, often as
I had passed the house, I now gazed at it for the first
time with an air of critical interest. In Kulu, for some
unexplained reason, this particular bungalow had
never counted; it was boycotted—no, that is not the
word—<i>ignored</i>, as if, like some undesirable character,
it had no place in the station’s thoughts. Nevertheless,
its position was sufficiently prominent—it stood
at a point where four ways met. Two gateless
entrances opened into different roads, as if determined
to obtrude upon public attention. Standing aloof
between the approaches was the house—large, red-tiled,
and built back in the shape of the letter “T”
from an enormous pillared porch, which, with some
tall adjacent trees, gave it an air of reserve and
dignity.</p>

<p>“The coolie with the keys has not arrived,” said
Netta, “so I will just take you round and show you
its capabilities myself. Here”—as we stumbled over
some rough grass—“is where I should make a couple
of Badminton courts, and this”—as we came to the
back of the bungalow—“is the garden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>Yes, here were old choked-up stone water-channels,
the traces of walks, hoary guava and apricot trees, a
stone pergola and a dead vine, also a well, with
elaborate tracery, and odd, shapeless mounds of
ancient masonry. As we stood we faced the back
verandah of the house. To our right hand lay tall
cork trees, a wide expanse of compound, and the
road; to our left, at a distance, more trees, a high
wall, and clustered beneath it the servants’ quarters,
the cook-house, and a long range of stables.</p>

<p>It was a fine, important-looking residence, although
the stables were almost roofless and the garden and
compound a wilderness, given over to stray goats
and tame lizards.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is only one thing I am afraid of,” exclaimed
Netta.</p>

<p>“Snakes?” I suggested. “It looks rather snaky.”</p>

<p>“No, the rent; and here comes the key at last,”
and as she spoke a fat young clerk, on a small yellow
pony, trotted quickly under the porch—a voluble
person, who wore spotless white garments, and spoke
English with much fluency.</p>

<p>“I am abject. Please excuse being so tardy. I
could not excavate the key; but at last I got it, and
now I will hasten to exhibit premises. First of all, I
go and open doors and windows, and call in the
atmosphere—ladies kindly excuse.” Leaving his
tame steed on its honour, the baboo hurried to the
back, and presently we heard the grinding of locks,
banging of shutters, and grating of bolts. Then the
door was flung open and we entered, walked (as is
usual) straight into the drawing-room, a fine, lofty,
half-circular room, twice as large and well-proportioned
as mine. The drawing-room led into an
equally excellent dining-room. I saw Netta measuring
it with her eye, and she said, “One could easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
seat thirty people here, and what a place for a
Christmas-tree!”</p>

<p>The dining-room opened into an immense bedroom
which gave directly on the back verandah, with a
flight of shallow steps leading into the garden.</p>

<p>“The nursery,” she whispered; “capital!”</p>

<p>At either side were two other rooms, with bath and
dressing-rooms complete. Undoubtedly it was an exceedingly
commodious and well-planned house.</p>

<p>As we stood once more in the nursery—all the wide
doors being open—we could see directly through the
bungalow out into the porch, as the three large apartments
were <i lang="fr">en suite</i>.</p>

<p>“A draught right through, you see!” she said.
“So cool in the hot weather.”</p>

<p>Then we returned to the drawing-room, where I
noticed that Netta was already arranging the furniture
with her mental eye. At last she turned to the
baboo and said, “And what is the rent?”</p>

<p>After a moment’s palpable hesitation he replied,
“Ninety rupees a month. If you take it for some
time it will be all put in repair and done up.”</p>

<p>“Ninety!” I mentally echoed—and we paid one
hundred and forty!</p>

<p>“Does it belong to John Mahomed?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No—to a client.”</p>

<p>“Does he live here?”</p>

<p>“No—he lives far away, in another region; we
have never seen him.”</p>

<p>“How long is it since this was occupied?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a good while——”</p>

<p>“Some years?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” with a wag of his head.</p>

<p>“Why has it stood empty? Is it unhealthy?”
asked Netta.</p>

<p>“Oh no, no. I think it is too majestic, too gigantic
for insignificant people. They like something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
more altogether and <i>cosy</i>; it is not cosy—it is suitable
to persons like a lady on the General’s staff,” and he
bowed himself to Netta.</p>

<p>I believe she was secretly of his opinion, for already
she had assumed the air of the mistress of the house,
and said briskly, “Now I wish to see the kitchen, and
servants’ quarters,” and, picking up her dainty skirts,
she led the way thither through loose stones and hard
yellow grass. As I have a rooted antipathy to dark
and uninhabited places, possibly the haunt of snakes
and scorpions, I failed to attend her, but, leaving the
baboo to continue his duty, turned back into the
house alone.</p>

<p>I paced the drawing-room, dining-room, the
nursery, and as I stood surveying the long vista of
apartments, with the sun pouring into the porch on
one hand, and on the green foliage and baked yellow
earth of the garden on the other, I confessed to myself
that Netta was a miracle!</p>

<p>She, a new arrival, had hit upon this excellent and
suitable residence; and a bargain. But, then, she
always found bargains; their discovery was her
<i lang="fr">métier</i>!</p>

<p>As I stood reflecting thus, gazing absently into the
outer glare, a dark and mysterious cloud seemed to
fall upon the place, the sun was suddenly obscured,
and from the portico came a sharp little gust of wind
that gradually increased into a long-drawn wailing
cry—surely the cry of some lost soul! What could
have put such a hideous idea in my head? But the
cry rang in my ears with such piercing distinctness
that I felt myself trembling from head to foot; in a
second the voice had, as it were, passed forth into the
garden and was stifled among the tamarind trees in
an agonised wail. I roused myself from a condition
of frightful obsession, and endeavoured to summon
my common sense and self-command. Here was I, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
middle-aged Scotchwoman, standing in this empty
bungalow, clutching my garden umbrella, and
imagining horrors!</p>

<p>Such thoughts I must keep exclusively to myself,
lest I become the laughing-stock of a station with a
keen sense of the ridiculous.</p>

<p>Yes, I was an imaginative old goose, but I walked
rather quickly back into the porch, and stepped into
the open air, with a secret but invincible prejudice
against the Red Bungalow. This antipathy was not
shared by Netta, who had returned from her quest all
animation and satisfaction.</p>

<p>“The stables require repair, and some of the go-downs,”
she said, “and the whole house must be recoloured
inside, and matted. I will bring my husband
round to-morrow morning,” she announced,
dismissing the baboo. “We will be here at eight
o’clock sharp.”</p>

<p>By this I knew—and so did the baboo—that the
Red Bungalow was let at last!</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of it?” asked Netta
triumphantly, as we were walking home together.</p>

<p>“It is a roomy house,” I admitted, “but there is
no office for Tom.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he has the Brigade Office.—Any more
objections?”</p>

<p>“A bungalow so long vacant, so entirely overlooked,
must have <i>something</i> against it—and it is not
the rent——”</p>

<p>“Nor is it unhealthy,” she argued. “It is quite
high, higher than your bungalow—no water near it,
and the trees not too close. I can see that you don’t
like it. Can you give me a good reason?”</p>

<p>“I really wish I could. No, I do not like it—there
is something about it that repels me. You know I’m
a Highlander, and am sensitive to impressions.”</p>

<p>“My dear Liz,” and here she came to a dead halt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
“you don’t mean me to suppose that you think it is
haunted? Why, this is the twentieth century!”</p>

<p>“I did not say it was haunted”—(I dared not voice
my fears)—“but I declare that I do not like it, and I
wish you’d wait; wait only a couple of days, and I’ll
take you to see the Watsons’ bungalow—so sunny,
so lived in—always so cheerful, with a lovely garden,
and an office for Tom.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that <i>that</i> is an advantage!” she exclaimed
with a smile. “It is not always agreeable
to have a man on the premises for twenty-four hours
out of the twenty-four hours!”</p>

<p>“But the Watsons——”</p>

<p>“My dear Liz, if you say another word about the
Watsons’ bungalow I shall have a bad attack of the
sulks, and go straight to bed!”</p>

<p>It is needless to mention that Tom was delighted
with the bungalow selected by his ever-clever little
wife, and for the next week our own abode was the
resort of tailors, hawkers, butchers, milkmen, furniture-makers,
ponies and cows on sale, and troops of
servants in quest of places.</p>

<p>Every day Netta went over to the house to inspect,
and to give directions, to see how the mallees were
laying out the garden and Badminton courts, and the
matting people and whitewashers were progressing
indoors.</p>

<p>Many hands make light work, and within a week
the transformation of the Red Bungalow was astonishing.
Within a fortnight it was complete; the stables
were again occupied—also the new spick-and-span
servants’ quarters; Badminton courts were ready to
be played upon; the verandah and porch were gay
with palms and plants and parrots, and the drawing-room
was the admiration of all Kulu. Netta introduced
plants in pots—pots actually dressed up in
pongee silk!—to the station ladies; her sofa cushions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
were frilled, she had quantities of pretty pictures and
photos, silver knick-knacks, and gay rugs.</p>

<p>But before Netta had had the usual name-board—“Major
Fellowes, A.Q.M.G.”—attached to the gate
piers of the Red Bungalow, there had been some
demur and remonstrance. My ayah, an old Madrasi,
long in my service, had ventured one day, as she held
my hair in her hand, “That new missus never taking
the old Red Bungalow?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“My missus then telling her, <i>please</i>, that plenty
bad place—oh, so bad! No one living there this
many years.”</p>

<p>“Why—what is it?”</p>

<p>“I not never knowing, only the one word—<i>bad</i>.
Oh, my missus! you speak, never letting these pretty
little children go there——”</p>

<p>“But other people have lived there, Mary——”</p>

<p>“Never long—so people telling—the house man
paint bungalow all so nice—same like now—they
make great bargain—so pleased. One day they go
away, away, away, never coming back. Please,
please,” and she stooped and kissed my hand, “speak
that master, tell him—<i>bad</i> bungalow.”</p>

<p>Of course I pooh-poohed the subject to Mary, who
actually wept, good kind creature, and as she did my
hair had constantly to dry her eyes on her saree.</p>

<p>And, knowing how futile a word to Tom would
prove, I once more attacked Netta. I said, “Netta,
I’m sure you think I’m an ignorant, superstitious
imbecile, but I believe in presentiments. I have a
presentiment, dear, about that Bungalow—<i>do</i> give it
up to please and, yes, comfort me——”</p>

<p>“What! my beautiful find—the best house in Kulu—my
<i>bargain</i>?”</p>

<p>“You may find it a dear bargain!”</p>

<p>“Not even to oblige you, dear Liz, can I break off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
my agreement, and I have really set my heart on your
<i lang="fr">bête noire</i>. I am so, so sorry,” and she came over
and caressed me.</p>

<p>I wonder if Netta in her secret heart suspected that
I, the Colonel’s wife, might be a little jealous that
the new arrival had secured a far more impressive
looking abode than her own, and for this mean reason
I endeavoured to persuade her to “move on.”</p>

<p>However, her mind must have been entirely disabused
of this by a lady on whom we were calling,
who said:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Fellowes, have you got a house yet, or
will you wait for the Watsons’? Such a——”</p>

<p>“I am already suited,” interrupted Netta. “We
have found just the thing—not far from my cousin’s,
too—a fine, roomy, cheerful place, with a huge compound;
we are already making the garden.”</p>

<p>“Roomy—large compound; near Mrs. Drummond,”
she repeated with knitted brow. “No—oh,
surely you do not mean the Red Bungalow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is its name; I am charmed with it, and
so lucky to find it.”</p>

<p>“No difficulty in finding it, dear Mrs. Fellowes,
but I believe the difficulty is in remaining there.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that it’s haunted?” enquired Netta
with a rather superior air.</p>

<p>“Something of that sort—the natives call it ‘the
devil’s house.’ A terrible tragedy happened there
long ago—so long ago that it is forgotten; but you
will find it almost impossible to keep servants!”</p>

<p>“You are certainly most discouraging, but I hope
some day you will come and dine with us, and see
how comfortable we are!”</p>

<p>There was a note of challenge in this invitation,
and I could see with the traditional “half-eye” that
Mrs. Dodd and Mrs. Fellowes would scarcely be
bosom friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>Nor was this the sole warning.</p>

<p>At the club a very old resident, wife of a Government
employé, who had spent twenty years in Kulu,
came and seated herself by me one morning with the
air of a person who desired to fulfil a disagreeable
duty.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will think me presuming, Mrs.
Drummond, but I feel that I <i>ought</i> to speak. Do you
know that the house your cousin has taken is said to
be unlucky? The last people only remained a month,
though they got it for next to nothing—a mere song.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve heard of these places, and read of them,
too,” I replied, “but it generally turns out that
someone has an interest in keeping it empty; possibly
natives live there.”</p>

<p>“<i>Any</i>where but there!” she exclaimed. “Not a
soul will go near it after night-fall—there is not even
the usual chokedar——”</p>

<p>“What is it? What is the tale?”</p>

<p>“Something connected with those old mounds of
brickwork, and the well. I think a palace or a temple
stood on the spot thousands of years ago, when Kulu
was a great native city.</p>

<p>“Do try and dissuade your cousin from going
there; she will find her mistake sooner or later. I
hope you won’t think me very officious, but she is
young and happy, and has two such dear children,
especially the little boy.”</p>

<p>Yes, especially the little boy! I was devoted to
Guy—my husband, too. We had bought him a pony
and a tiny monkey, and were only too glad to keep
him and Baba for a few days when their parents took
the great step and moved into the Red Bungalow.</p>

<p>In a short time all was in readiness; the big end
room made a delightful nursery; the children had
also the run of the back verandah and the garden,
and were soon completely and happily at home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>An inhabited house seems so different to the same
when it stands silent, with closed doors—afar from
the sound of voices and footsteps. I could scarcely
recognise Netta’s new home. It was the centre of half
the station gaieties—Badminton parties twice a week,
dinners, “Chotah Hazra” gatherings on the great
verandah, and rehearsals for a forthcoming play; the
pattering of little feet, servants, horses, cows, goats,
dogs, parrots, all contributed their share to the
general life and stir. I went over to the Bungalow
almost daily: I dined, I breakfasted, I had tea, and I
never saw anything but the expected and the commonplace,
yet I failed to eradicate my first instinct, my
secret apprehension and aversion. Christmas was
over, the parties, dinners and teas were among
memories of the past; we were well advanced in the
month of February, when Netta, the triumphant,
breathed her first complaint. The servants—excellent
servants, with long and <i lang="la">bonâ fide</i> characters—arrived,
stayed one week, or perhaps two, and then came and
said, “Please I go!”</p>

<p>None of them remained in the compound at night,
except the horsekeepers and an orderly; they retired
to more congenial quarters in an adjoining bazaar,
and the maddening part was that they would give no
definite name or shape to their fears—they spoke of
“It” and a “Thing”—a fearsome object, that dwelt
within and around the Bungalow.</p>

<p>The children’s ayah, a Madras woman, remained
loyal and staunch; she laughed at the Bazaar tales
and their reciters; and, as her husband was the cook,
Netta was fairly independent of the cowardly crew
who nightly fled to the Bazaar.</p>

<p>Suddenly the ayah, the treasure, fell ill of fever—the
really virulent fever that occasionally seizes on
natives of the country, and seems to lick up their very
life. As my servants’ quarters were more comfortable—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
I am something of a nurse—I took the invalid
home, and Netta promoted her understudy (a
local woman) temporarily into her place. She was a
chattering, gay, gaudy creature, that I had never
approved, but Netta would not listen to any advice,
whether with respect to medicines, servants, or
bungalows. Her choice in the latter had undoubtedly
turned out well, and she was not a little exultant,
and bragged to me that <i>she</i> never left it in anyone’s
power to say, “There—I told you so!”</p>

<p>It was Baba’s birthday—she was two—a pretty,
healthy child, but for her age backward: beyond
“Dadda,” “Mamma,” and “Ayah,” she could not
say one word. However, as Tom cynically remarked,
“she was bound to make up for it by and by!”</p>

<p>It was twelve o’clock on this very warm morning
when I took my umbrella and topee and started off
to help Netta with her preparations for the afternoon.
The chief feature of the entertainment was to be a
bran pie.</p>

<p>I found my cousin hard at work when I arrived.
In the verandah a great bath-tub full of bran had
been placed on a table, and she was draping the said
tub with elegant festoons of pink glazed calico—her
implement a hammer and tacks—whilst I burrowed
into the bran, and there interred the bodies of dolls
and cats and horses, and all manner of pleasant surprises.
We were making a dreadful litter, and a
considerable noise, when suddenly above the hammering
I heard a single sharp cry.</p>

<p>“Listen!” I said.</p>

<p>“Oh, Baba is awake—naughty child—and she will
disturb her brother,” replied the mother, selecting a
fresh tack. “The ayah is there. Don’t go.”</p>

<p>“But it had such an odd, uncanny sound,” I protested.</p>

<p>“Dear old Liz! how nervous you are! Baba’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
scream is something between a whistle of an express
and a fog-horn. She has abnormal lung power—and
to-day she is restless and upset by her birthday—and
her teeth. Your fears——”</p>

<p>Then she stopped abruptly, for a loud, frantic
shriek, the shriek of extreme mortal terror, now rose
high above her voice, and, throwing the hammer
from her, Netta fled into the drawing-room, overturning
chairs in her route, dashed across the drawing-room,
and burst into the nursery, from whence
came these most appalling cries. There, huddled
together, we discovered the two children on the table
which stood in the middle of the apartment. Guy
had evidently climbed up by a chair, and dragged his
sister along with him. It was a beautiful afternoon,
the sun streamed in upon them, and the room, as far
as we could see, was empty. Yes, but not empty to
the trembling little creatures on the table, for with
wide, mad eyes they seemed to follow the motion of a
something that was creeping round the room close to
the wall, and I noticed that their gaze went up and
down, as they accompanied its progress with starting
pupils and gasping breaths.</p>

<p>“Oh! <i>what</i> is it, my darling?” cried Netta, seizing
Guy, whilst I snatched at Baba.</p>

<p>He stretched himself stiffly in her arms, and, pointing
with a trembling finger to a certain spot, gasped,
“Oh, Mummy! look, look, <i>look</i>!” and with the last
word, which was a shriek of horror, he fell into violent
convulsions.</p>

<p>But look as we might, we could see nothing, save
the bare matting and the bare wall. What frightful
object had made itself visible to these innocent
children has never been discovered to the present day.</p>

<p>Little Guy, in spite of superhuman efforts to save
him, died of brain fever, unintelligible to the last;
the only words we could distinguish among his ravings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
were, “Look, look, look! Oh, Mummy! look,
look, look!” and as for Baba, whatever was seen by
her is locked within her lips, for she remains dumb
to the present day.</p>

<p>The ayah had nothing to disclose; she could only
beat her head upon the ground and scream, and declare
that she had just left the children for a moment
to speak to the milkman.</p>

<p>But other servants confessed that the ayah had been
gossiping in the cook-house for more than half an
hour. The sole living creature that had been with
the children when “It” had appeared to them, was
Guy’s little pet monkey, which was subsequently
found under the table quite dead.</p>

<p>At first I was afraid that after the shock of Guy’s
death poor Netta would lose her reason. Of course
they all came to us, that same dreadful afternoon,
leaving the birthday feast already spread, the bran
pie in the verandah, the music on the piano; never
had there been such a hasty flight, such a domestic
earthquake. We endeavoured to keep the mysterious
tragedy to ourselves. Little Guy had brain fever;
surely it was natural that relations should be together
in their trouble, and I declared that I, being a noted
nurse, had bodily carried off the child, who was followed
by the whole family.</p>

<p>People talked of “A stroke of the sun,” but I
believe something of the truth filtered into the Bazaar—where
all things are known. Shortly after little
Guy’s death Netta took Baba home, declaring she
would never, never return to India, and Tom applied
for and obtained a transfer to another station. He
sold off the household furniture, the pretty knick-knacks,
the pictures, all that had gone to make Netta’s
house so attractive, for she could not endure to look
on them again. They had been in <i>that</i> house. As
for the Red Bungalow, it is once more closed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
silent. The squirrels and hoo-poos share the garden,
the stables are given over to scorpions, the house to
white ants. On application to John Mahomed, anyone
desirous of becoming a tenant will certainly find
that it is still to be had for a mere song!</p>

THE SCARECROW</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Edgar Lovett</span>, Esq., B.A., Collector of Munser,
lounged in a long chair in his verandah, enjoying an
excellent cheroot; and as he had but recently
despatched a satisfactory day’s work and a fairly
satisfactory meal, the condition of his mind was
serene.</p>

<p>Lovett was a clever, hard-working civilian—to
whom the adjective “rising” had been applied; he
was thirty years of age, heir to a nice property—and
unmarried.</p>

<p>In a fair-haired, grave-eyed style the collector was
not ill-looking, strong to hold his own with mankind
in club, cricket-field, or cutcherry; but in the society
of ladies, he—so to speak—went to pieces, and
became pathetically anxious to please—nervous, sensitive,
and shy.</p>

<p>The years he had spent in an out-of-the-way district
had ill-prepared him for his present position, where,
advanced to a large station, he found himself within
the circuit of those rays which beat upon an important
official, and the object of benevolent interest to ladies
both young and old.</p>

<p>Lovett was not alone on the present occasion; the
slight lad who was strutting up and down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
verandah, with his hands in his pockets, and a cheroot
in his mouth, was his youngest brother, Bobbie, midshipman
on H.M.S. <i>Bobadil</i>, then on the East Indian
station, who had obtained two days’ leave ashore, and
had run down from Bombay to pay his relation a visit.</p>

<p>Bobby was “a pretty boy” with a pair of mischievous,
long-lashed eyes, a fresh complexion, and
a crop of curly chestnut hair; he was also a youth with
a bold, enterprising character, and a peculiarly active
mind.</p>

<p>“I say, old man,” he exclaimed, suddenly accosting
his elder, “you seem to have done yourself pretty well
in this berth! A 1 bungalow—furnished and fitted
out first-class, with sofas, cushions, and lampshades—there
is even a tea-cosy, and a piano!”</p>

<p>“The last tenant was married,” explained Lovett,
“and I took over everything, just as it stood, down
to the matting.”</p>

<p>“Then you have a capital cook, a fine trapper, two
polo ponies, lots of shooting in the district, not a debt
or care in the world—I wish I were in your shoes.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! sometimes I wish you <i>were</i>!” was the
unexpected rejoinder.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? I thought your luck was
dead in when you got this move—an awfully good
thing.”</p>

<p>“In some ways—too much of a good thing.”</p>

<p>“Pray explain this dark saying!”</p>

<p>“Too many women.”</p>

<p>Bobby burst into a shout of laughter, and then
exclaimed, “I say, you must be hard up for something
to grumble at.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m bothered out of my life—and sometimes
I think I’ll have to marry one of the lot, to keep
the others off.”</p>

<p>“Come now, Ted! you are not so attractive as all
that! One would suppose you were a pot of honey.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
I say, you’re chaffing!” and the younger Lovett sat
down cross-legged on a chair, rested his elbows on
the back, and stared at his brother with round,
twinkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Chaffing, no! This station is overrun with
ladies. The good old days when a white woman was
a <i lang="la">rara avis</i> departed sixty years ago. Even within
the last ten, matters have gone from bad to worse—in
the way of imported spins. People then had out their
relations—now they open their arms to all the world,
and take in lodgers—I mean paying guests! Guests,
whose one idea is that the great Indian Empire is
merely run in order to afford facilities for flirtation
and matrimony: and it is not the girls themselves
who are the plague—it is the chaperones, and mothers,
and aunts.—Oh, bring it up!” he added in Hindustani,
as a smart peon, with a brass badge on his belt,
salaamed at the foot of the steps, letter in hand.</p>

<p>This letter Lovett tore open, cast his eyes over it,
and called out “Salaam,” and the messenger, with
another profound salutation, resumed his shoes, and
clattered out of sight.</p>

<p>“Now here is a sample,” said Lovett, holding out
the “chit” to Bobby, who made a long arm for it,
and presently read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Lovett</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>“Mother desires me to write and remind you that you
dine with us to-morrow—this time <i>no excuse</i> will avail
you. I am sorry to say I have again given my tiresome
pony a sore back; will you lend me ‘Pinkatee’?—my
saddle fits her as if it were made for her. I will send over
the syce at three o’clock this afternoon. Do not trouble
to answer, but say ‘Salaam’ if you are going to be a
<i>dear</i>. I do hope I shall see you at the polo.</p>

<p class="right">“Ever yours most sincerely, &#160; &#160; &#160;<br>

“<span class="smcap">Totty A. Tompkins</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“I shouldn’t call you a dear, but an ass!”
announced Bobby, crumpling up the note. “Why
do you lend the animal?”</p>

<p>“Because it is less trouble in the long run——”</p>

<p>“But riding a man’s pony is almost the same as
announcing that you are ‘walking out.’”</p>

<p>“They all ride my ponies—so there is safety in a
multitude!”</p>

<p>“And who are the multitude?”</p>

<p>“Well, there are Colonel and Mrs. Tompkins—they
have two daughters, a niece, and a paying guest.
The opium wallah has three daughters; Mrs. Briton,
wife of the civil engineer, harbours two friends; the
Padre’s wife has two nieces; and the wife of the Major
is expecting a relation.”</p>

<p>“Hullo, what’s all this hubbub inside?” enquired
Bobby, as the sound of many subdued voices, a
scuffling and moving of furniture, came from within.</p>

<p>“Wait and you will see,” replied his brother
calmly.</p>

<p>In a moment the chick over the drawing-room door
was pushed aside, and two bare-legged coolies came
grunting forth backwards; then a portion of the piano—finally
the whole instrument—emerged; it was
carried by six men, who subsequently bore it away
out of the compound, headed by a majestic butler in a
gigantic turban.</p>

<p>“I have seen,” declared Bobby, “and now await
information.”</p>

<p>“The piano has been borrowed by Mrs. Briton—she
is having a musical At Home.”</p>

<p>“How often do you lend it?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, as I don’t play or use it myself—like
a popular novel, it is almost always ‘out.’”</p>

<p>“I say,” exclaimed Bobby, “here is someone
coming—I’m off,” and without further hesitation he
bolted into the bungalow, and, from behind the chick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
beheld two ladies drive up in a high dogcart. They
remained talking to the unhappy collector for fully
twenty minutes, whilst he stood before them, bare-headed,
courteous, resigned.</p>

<p>“You’re bringing it all on yourself!” commented
the listener, when they departed. “You are ten times
too agreeable. I heard you agreeing to give a picnic,
and offering the loan of your ice machine. If they
came and <i>lived</i> here I would not pity you—you
encourage them!”</p>

<p>“How can a man be rude to women in his own
house, you young savage, and how can he refuse
things that are asked for point-blank?”</p>

<p>“They wanted you to invite them in—<i>twice</i> they
told you they had had no tea.”</p>

<p>“I could not well offer them hospitality, when you
were lurking behind the chick—could I? Here comes
another chit! From Mrs. Trotter. Can I spare them
my dirzee for a week?—and will I go over and dine
quietly, and bring my brother?—So they have found
<i>you</i> out!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not on! this is the only evening we
have—I’m off to-morrow; and if the lady comes round
to fetch you by force, I shall make you fast with the
punkah rope.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“I now grasp the whole question,” announced
young Lovett sententiously, as he and his brother
dined together, “you are afraid of your life of all
these good ladies; a small station where there were
only three or four Europeans has ruined your nerve—and
here you say ‘yes’ to everything. You cannot
say ‘no.’ All the women know it, and think you so
good-natured, so amiable, so—charming—such an
acquisition; they told me so, on the club verandah;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
they nearly mobbed me! Of course you are the most
eligible man in Munser, and you will never leave it a
bachelor—alive! What would you give these kind
Mammas to leave you in peace?”</p>

<p>“Anything! even to the half of my pay!”</p>

<p>“Give me a new sporting rifle, and I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>“Bobby, don’t be an ass!”</p>

<p>“No, bar all chaff—I don’t mean murder!—but if
you will order me an express, I will guarantee to
relieve you of every single invitation, and to rid you
of ladies’ society for ever and a day; they won’t come
near you!”</p>

<p>“You speak as if you were a species of insecticide.”</p>

<p>“I shall prove as efficient as the best Keating’s—and
deliver you from this plague of women.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that depends!—you must leave me to do it in
my own good time, and my own good way—but it
shall be <i>done</i>. I’ll never forget how Mrs. Tompkins
bore down on you to-night like an old three-decker,
and boarded you with grappling irons, and how the
little fair girl came, and cut you out—to Badminton—from
under her heavy guns; and Mrs. Briton assured
me that she takes a motherly interest in you, and that
her niece Julia thinks you too fascinating for words.
Of course you are too civil by half.”</p>

<p>“No—in that lies my sole safety. I do my best
to be civil to them all—I make no dangerous distinctions,
but it is killing work!—like keeping half a
dozen balls in the air.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Dacre, the sister of Mrs. Lawrence (wife of a
Major in the Buffers), arrived at Munser early in the
season. She was a graceful, dark-eyed girl, endowed
with an unusual share of vivacity and charm, who
gravely assured her sister that she had not travelled to
the East in order to be wooed and wed, and that any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
attempt to find her a husband would be fruitless, if
not disastrous.</p>

<p>“Everyone seems to think that when a girl goes to
India she puts herself up in the marriage market!”
she declared. “Well, my dear, there is a reserve on
<i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>Ida Dacre was fully as quick as Bobby Lovett in
grasping the position of the collector, and she (privately)
made great fun of the little tin god and his
worshippers, and held herself aloof from him, in a
manner so remarkable that his interest was awakened.
“Here, at least,” he said to himself, “is one girl who
pointedly avoids me—snubs me—when we do meet,
and plainly cannot endure the sight of me! I wonder
what I have done, or left undone?”</p>

<p>Miss Dacre had expected the much-sought-after
gentleman to be abominably conceited, egotistical and
spoiled, but one day, when they were both sheltering
in a “tope” from a shower, she was agreeably surprised
to discover that his opinion of himself was of
the humblest—that he had been at school—and in the
same house—with her pet brother, and that he really
was not at all bad! She suffered him to ride back
with her to the cantonment, and at an early date permitted
her sister to invite him to dinner. Miss Dacre
was a pretty girl, and an accomplished musician, but
she had a mischievous sense of humour and a witty
tongue. She teased the little tin god; she flouted
him, and repelled him with her jeers, whilst her merry,
mocking eyes held him fast. Edgar Lovett became
her slave—he was desperately in love, but dared not
declare his sentiments, the lady being so perplexingly
reserved. Oh, if he only had one ray of hope he
would have spoken—but his goddess gave no sign.
She rode with him, and quarrelled, and danced, and
laughed, and mocked, and argued—and drove the
poor fellow distracted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>He had frequently, but vainly, invited Miss Dacre
and her sister to come to tea in his bungalow, and to
inspect and borrow his books. He promised them a
tempting exhibition of all his latest publications:
after long demur, a date was positively fixed. Unfortunately,
just before this happy event, Lovett was
obliged to leave the cantonment for two days’ official
duty in the district. His business accomplished, he
returned to Munser in a fever of anxiety. His train
was behind time, and he was desperately afraid that
he would arrive too late to receive his honoured and
important guests.</p>

<p>Outside the station Lovett looked in vain for his
smart dogcart and fast stepper—instead of which he
found one of his own peons awaiting him, with a dusty
old gharry.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this?” he demanded, in
imperious Hindustani, “where is the cart?”</p>

<p>“Light of the World,” replied the man, “by your
favour, the Missy Sahib hath taken it.”</p>

<p>“Missy—what Miss Sahib?”</p>

<p>“The Missy who has been at your honour’s house
this two days.”</p>

<p>Lovett sprang into the gharry shouting the word
“Chullo!” and was soon swept out of the station,
in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>Ten minutes’ galloping brought him to where his
own trim yet dignified bungalow stood, in a large
compound, within a few yards of the principal highroad;
and throwing a rupee to the driver, he dashed
up the steps, and flung into the drawing-room. No,
they had not arrived—the house was empty. It was
after six o’clock, and here the bearer appeared—grave-eyed,
and with a troubled mien.</p>

<p>“Did two ladies come for tea?” inquired Lovett.</p>

<p>“No, Huzoor, but one lady been here two days;
breakfast, tiffin, and dinner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“<i>What?</i>”</p>

<p>“Yes, she telling me she is the Sahib’s—cousin—same
like sister—and come from England.”</p>

<p>“There must be some mistake,” muttered Lovett,
staring at the scattered cushions, the crumpled newspapers,
and stumps of cigarettes which littered his
usually neat verandah.</p>

<p>“Here, the Missy now coming!” announced the
bearer, and he indicated with a tragic finger the dogcart,
spanking down the road, in which sat a slim,
upright, female form, wearing a jaunty sailor-hat and
a gay pink frock. The dogcart rattled into the compound,
and up to the steps, and an absolutely strange
girl called out to the bewildered Lovett:</p>

<p>“Hullo, so there you are! So glad to see you
at last!”</p>

<p>She threw the reins to the syce, jumped down, and
was presently shaking the collector’s limp, reluctant
hand.</p>

<p>“Now come inside,” she said, taking him by the
arm, and lifting the chick, “and I’ll tell you <i>all</i> about
it—I daresay you are a little bit surprised?”</p>

<p>Lovett, dumbfounded, stood speechless, for the
moment mentally stunned, staring into the smiling
face and bold, saucy eyes of his companion.</p>

<p>A thick curly fringe of yellow hair peeped out
beneath the sailor-hat; her dress, though merely
cotton, was elaborately trimmed, and frilled; round
her neck was a huge lace ruffle.</p>

<p>Her manner was but too assured—and she was
apparently quite sane.</p>

<p>“You have heard of the Dales, your cousins?”
she resumed.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, they are my cousins <i>too</i>. I came out to
stay with friends—not far from here—and they have
measles, and could not take me in. So I cast about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
what to do, and thought of <i>you</i>, Teddy Lovett.
Everyone knows how good-natured you are, and such
a ladies’ man—and so here I am, taking you by storm!
By the way, can I have a whisky and soda?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Boy, <i>peg loa</i>!”</p>

<p>The bearer promptly entered, and the refreshment
was presented to the lady, who swallowed half a
tumblerful at a gulp.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she resumed with a smirk, “if I were
at home I could not billet myself on you like this. But
in India, I believe, there are no silly conventions; the
Dales said you were an awfully good sort, and——”</p>

<p>“And of course,” broke in Lovett, “I am glad to
have it in my power to oblige any friend of theirs——”</p>

<p>“Cousin,” corrected the lady.</p>

<p>“But India is not at all so unconventional as you
suppose, Miss—er——”</p>

<p>“Ruby Scarlett,” she supplemented quickly.</p>

<p>“And so, Miss Scarlett, I will find quarters elsewhere,
and leave you the house to yourself—until your
friends think it possible to receive you. If you want
anything you will hear of me at the Dâk Bungalow—and
meanwhile pray make yourself quite at home.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, awfully—you are really too dear and
kind for words! By rights, I should go to the Dâk
Bungalow, but I’m a little afraid of the fowl! I don’t
know why, but one always hears that one should give
a Dâk Bungalow fowl a wide berth. I suppose they
are savage?”</p>

<p>“If you will excuse me, I will go and make some
arrangements,” rejoined Lovett, in a chilly voice,
totally ignoring her question; and with a bow he
turned to depart. As he reached the door, his ears
were saluted by a shrill whistle. He looked quickly
round, and beheld Miss Ruby Scarlett, minus hat and
wig—and, grinning above her white ruffle, the
impudent face of his brother Bobby!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“Took a jolly good rise out of you, didn’t I?” he
cried.</p>

<p>“Yes,” with an air of relief; “but what in heaven’s
name is the meaning of this dressing-up, and tom-foolery?”</p>

<p>“Sit down there and have a cheroot, and pull yourself
together, old man, and you shall hear. I declare
you look—completely shattered!”</p>

<p>“Enough to shatter anyone!” pointing to his
brother’s costume. “What does it all mean? I’m
no good at dumb crambo, or charades.”</p>

<p>“It means, dear brother, that I am here as your
‘scarecrow.’ My office is to keep the birds off—in
other words, the ladies, and I have succeeded to a
miracle!”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, Bobby, what <i>have</i> you been up to?”
demanded Lovett, in genuine alarm.</p>

<p>“Well, listen to my little tale”; crossing his legs,
and proceeding with an air of easy narration. “I
have earned that rifle nobly—as you shall hear.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said his brother huskily, “tell me the
worst—and get it over.”</p>

<p>“The worst?” echoed Bobby. “There is no
worst! It’s the best joke I’ve ever known, bar none—a
screaming farce.</p>

<p>“We are great at theatricals on the <i>Bobadil</i>, quite
a floating Haymarket. We had been playing a piece
called ‘Topsy-Turvy’ in which I had a star part, first
leading lady, and I yearned to show myself to you—and
take you in. So when we got to Bombay this
cruise, I put in for a week ashore, collected a box of
properties, borrowed the bearer of a chum in the
Yacht Club, and persuaded him to bring along his
old wife as my ayah. Then we all took the train for
Munser. I made up in the carriage—started a man
in flannels, stepped out a giddy girl in frills and curls!
I declare when the bearer came to the door, and saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
me, he nearly had a fit! Well, I drove straight up
here and I was awfully sold not to find you; but I
sent them all flying about, and ordered tea in the
verandah. Presently I went out, and spread myself
there, in a sort of blazing scarlet tea-gown—a thing
you could see a mile off! It had the desired effect—it
fetched the station! They rode, and biked, and
drove by—all staring, in the rudest and most shameless
manner. I kissed my hand to one of the men—he
looked like the Padre; another was for coming in—but
I waved him off!”</p>

<p>Lovett’s half-stifled groan was unheeded, and
possibly unheard.</p>

<p>“The funniest thing was a landau, packed full of
women—an excited old lady and some girls. They
went by at a trot, then turned, and came back at a
walk; finally, and lastly, a crawl. I believe they found
it impossible to realise <i>me</i>! The old girl put up a big
double eyeglass and fixed me with an expression of
such ferocity, that in self-defence I snatched a saucer,
stuck it in my eye, and gazed back with such killing
effect that she collapsed—completely repulsed—and
shouted to the coachman, ‘Full steam ahead!’ leaving
me with the honours of war! Then, yesterday,
I put on my own togs, and went for a ride in the
morning, and called in at the club. There were a
few men there, discussing the figure in the collector’s
verandah. They were inclined to have it that it was
stuffed! Of course this point of view was fatal to
my scheme. So yesterday evening I turned out in the
dogcart in a flaring hat and frock, and spanked about
the station, and down to the polo, and up to the cricket-field—not
much sign of a stuffed figure there. Several
people accosted me, but I only replied in French.
Thanks to our nurse I speak it like a native. I smoked
a cigarette, and dashed recklessly about the cantonment—and
have, I flatter myself, given them something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
to talk about. This afternoon I was feeling
rather dull, and was lying on a lounge, reading and
half-asleep, and wondering when you would appear,
when the bearer entered, and whispered that two Mem
Sahibs were in the drawing-room—come to tea! I
pulled myself together, and peeped through a hole in
the purdah. There was the Major’s wife, and another
lady, a tall, dark girl, with a ripping figure, cruising
about the room as if the place belonged to her! She
was examining your little family gods, photos, pet
ink-bottle, books, and your last new photo just
arrived——”</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded his brother breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Well, I ordered in tea, and hurried off to my
bower to titivate—as here I was at close quarters, you
see, and had to be careful! I settled on my wig and
hat, lace tie, and bead chains; I powdered my nose,
and put a good bit of colour on my cheeks—for it was
now going to be war to the knife! These women had
boldly boarded the ship, and I was determined to
scuttle their craft.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bobby, you idiot! you have ruined me!”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. Be calm, and listen. When I
pranced into the room the two ladies stared as if I
were some wild beast. ‘<i>So</i> pleased to see you,’ I
said; ‘<i>so</i> sweet and good of you to call on me! I’ve
been feeling a bit chippy all by my little lone.’</p>

<p>“‘We did not know we were to have this pleasure,’
said the dark girl, breathing hard, and white as a sheet—very
angry, I could see. ‘Mr. Lovett invited us
over to tea this afternoon and to see his books.’</p>

<p>“‘His books!’ I rejoined. ‘What an imposter!
His only books are woman’s looks!’</p>

<p>“‘Indeed,’ she snapped. ‘Nevertheless, I notice
a good many volumes here,’ and she pointed to the
shelves that line this room.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Lovett, I gather, is not at home,’ said Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Lawrence, speaking for the first time, and looking as
stiff as a ramrod.</p>

<p>“‘Alas, no!’ I replied in my most effective
theatrical manner.”</p>

<p>Lovett senior had jumped to his feet, and was now
pacing the room, whilst Lovett junior, lolling in a long
chair, with a cigarette between his fingers, related his
experience with unquestionable unction.</p>

<p>“I went on to say that my name was Ruby Scarlett,
that I had come out to ‘do’ India, and as I had known
Mr. Lovett very, <i>very</i> intimately at home, my first visit
was naturally to him; and I was frightfully disappointed
to have lost two days of his society—but I
was expecting him every moment.</p>

<p>“‘Did he know you were coming to-day?’ the dark
one asked me point-blank, and her eyes were so
piercing I could not bring out a lie, and so I said:</p>

<p>“‘No, I am a pleasant surprise! Now,’ I added,
fumbling for the tea-pot, ‘let me give you some tea.
Mr. Lovett is my cousin, I want to do the honours of
his house nicely.’</p>

<p>“But they would not stay—not a little bit of it;
nothing would induce them to remain, and they were
so stiff and fierce they riled me, and I said:</p>

<p>“‘Ah, I see how it is! Perhaps you’d rather have
something else—whisky and soda—and cigarettes.
Pray don’t hesitate; really, I’m not a <i>bit</i> prudish.’</p>

<p>“‘No, thank you,’ said the dark one, ‘I do not
smoke—nor do I ever drink whisky and soda. We
are immensely obliged to you for so kindly doing the
honours of your cousin’s house—we had no conception
of the agreeable surprise Mr. Lovett had
arranged for us—or that he had such a refined and
distinguished visitor! Good-afternoon.’ And with
that, my dear sir, she made me a most elegant bow,
and sailed out, followed by her sister! If ever I saw
two women shaking the dust off their feet, as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
left your compound, it was those ladies. I expect
they came to borrow your piano, or a pony, or your
cook. Well, I flatter myself they won’t trouble you
<i>again</i>!”</p>

<p>Lovett was now sitting down, with his head
between his hands, in an attitude that expressed the
most measureless despair!</p>

<p>“Hullo, old boy!” cried his brother, wheeling
about, “what’s up? What has happened?”</p>

<p>“Everything that could spoil my life has happened,”
he said, raising his face to his brother’s
astonished gaze. “You have ruined me! Yes, this
is the result of your infernal practical joking, and tom-fool
craze.”</p>

<p>“My what-t? I don’t understand,” stammered
Bobby. “When I was here before, you were nearly
crazy with all this plague of women. I thought if I
came down, and dressed up a bit, it would be a lark,
and——”</p>

<p>“And——?”</p>

<p>“Well, I see I have gone too far, and I’m awfully
sorry; but it was such splendid fun—I’ve never known
anything to touch it.”</p>

<p>“Play to you, and death to me!”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ve overdone it. I kept acting, and
feeling as if I were on the stage. I forgot my
<i>audience</i>. I’m frightfully sorry, old boy; what can
I do to make amends?”</p>

<p>“Nothing whatever, the mischief is done—and of
all people Mrs. Lawrence and her sister! Their visit
was long promised—they have never come before,
often as I asked them.”</p>

<p>“Then you <i>wanted</i> them to come?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing in the world I want so much as
for Miss Dacre to come here—and stay for good. She
is the only girl in the world for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“Oh, my hairy aunt! And I’ve put my foot in it
nicely!”</p>

<p>“She came out since your last trip, and was always
very cool and reserved, yet the first day I saw her I
knew she was my fate. I’d have spoken long ago,
only she never gave me the slightest encouragement.
By degrees, I got to know her better. I was invited
there, and as a great favour she promised to come
here, and choose some books. I looked on this as
a hopeful step—a good omen. It was arranged that
she and her sister were to come to-day—my beastly
train was three hours late. Well, she came, and found
<i>you</i>, painted, and bragging, and offering cigarettes
and whisky! Do you think she will ever speak to me
again? She will believe I have insulted her on purpose.
You’d better go back to your ship, Bobby;
you have done enough mischief to last for some time.”</p>

<p>“I must go to-night, anyhow,” rejoined Bobby,
“my leave is up,” and gathering up his hat and wig
he scampered out of the room.</p>

<p>Once in his own apartment, Bobby lit another
cigarette, and sat down to meditate. His round,
merry face looked unusually grave and thoughtful.
At last he had made up his mind. He called his
bearer, and ordered a gharry. Then he replaced his
wig and hat and veil, desiring his servant to pack his
effects and leave out his own clothes. Having given
these orders, he scrambled into the conveyance, and
told the man to drive to Major Lawrence’s—“<i>Jeldi!</i>”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As was only to be expected, Miss Dacre and her
sister returned from their unpleasant encounter in a
condition of high and talkative indignation.</p>

<p>They were seated in the verandah, still discussing
their amazing experience, when Miss Dacre, suddenly
pointing with a trembling hand, exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“Why, I believe the creature is actually coming
over here!”</p>

<p>“She is,” assented Mrs. Lawrence. “I recognise
her pink frock. She is returning our call—like
Royalty—within the hour. Fly, fly, Ida, and tell the
bearer ‘<i>Darwaza-Bund!</i>’”</p>

<p>But unfortunately Ida was too late—one moment
too late. Miss Scarlett had already descended, had
bustled up the steps, and screamed out:</p>

<p>“I say, I want to speak to you, Miss Dacre! I
wish to see you <i>alone</i>!”</p>

<p>Miss Dacre drew herself up; her face and air
stiffened.</p>

<p>“Please, please,” urged the caller, under her
breath; “it is of the greatest importance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well, come into the dining-room,” said
the other, with a somewhat ungracious air. What
could this fearful person possibly have to say to her—alone!
As soon as they had entered the room the
visitor began:</p>

<p>“Mr. Lovett has returned. He is raging mad with
me. I’ve made one of my usual awful blunders,
and I’ve come over here post-haste to apologise to
<i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>Miss Dacre, still standing, merely bowed her head
like a sea-tossed iceberg.</p>

<p>“I got hold of the wrong end of the stick!”
resumed the stranger, “and now I want to explain.
You see—I’m Lovett’s brother—just dressed up, and,
as he says—playing the fool!”</p>

<p>Miss Dacre stared for a moment—then as he tore
off his hat and wig, and stood revealed, she suddenly
sat down and burst into a scream of hysterical
laughter—the laughter of misery relieved.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m awfully glad you are taking it like
that!” he said, also seating himself, “and I do hope
you and your sister will forgive me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“But what possessed you to do it?” she gasped
out.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m always doing queer things. I’ve loved
playing jokes ever since I could speak. I act a bit,
and as I’m rather short and smooth-faced, in the
ship’s theatricals I play the young lady. I am quite
a star! I’ve just come ashore from our last cruise,
where I made a splendid hit as Miss Ruby Scarlett!”</p>

<p>“But what put it into your head to play the part
<i>here</i>?” demanded the girl.</p>

<p>“Well, now,” drawing his chair six inches nearer,
and dropping his voice into a key of easy confidence,
“you know my brother Ted, what an awfully soft-hearted,
good-natured, unselfish beggar he is? He
was always the same, and when I stopped here some
months ago I found he was just preyed upon by half
the ladies in the station. One wanted his ponies,
another his dirzee, a third his piano, and so on—and
all desired his company! I declare he could not call
his soul his own. He is stiff enough with men—but
with women he is just like a bit of putty. He is afraid
of you all—he respects the lot of you! You see, we
have no sisters, and he is so chivalrous and humble
that you impose upon him! He was having rather a
bad time when I came—a chit or a message or a call
every ten minutes—and so I offered to rid him of the
plague of women—half in joke, half in earnest, you
see. Then I was so delighted with myself as Miss
Ruby Scarlett, that a brilliant idea struck me. I’d
rush down to Munser for a couple of days—take a rise
out of him, and scare away his visitors!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented the lady, and her eyes danced.</p>

<p>“You agree with me it was a temptation! He was
away, as you know, and I played, in one respect, to
an empty house, but I had ripping fun, and I’ve scandalised
his bearer nearly to death. Well, now Edgar
is back. I took him in properly at first. Lord! you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
should have seen his face! and heard his frosty welcome!
When I discovered myself, at first he was
shocked. I’m used to that—that is nothing—but
when he heard of your and your sister’s call, he was
most frightfully cut up. I never saw him so bowled
over. He has told me to clear! But before I depart
to-night—and I must—leave up—I want to make a
clean breast, and apologise to <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“But why more to <i>me</i> than to my sister?”</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Dacre, though you ask the question
you know the answer. Because Edgar thinks there is
no one in all the world like you. I suppose he has not
dared to tell you himself, but I tell you—he is a gone
coon!” Miss Dacre suddenly became scarlet. “I—I—mean
that he loves you with all his heart and
soul, and all that sort of thing. He has never cared
a snap for any girl before—and never will again—and
I’ve been and gone and ruined his life! Oh, Miss
Dacre,” suddenly pouncing on her hand, “do give
me a little, little scrap of hope to take him—you don’t
know what a good fellow he is—then he’ll forgive
me, and I’ll cut my cable with such a jolly light
heart!”</p>

<p>Ida Dacre stared. This was her first proposal, and
it was being made second-hand, by an impudent,
curly-haired middy, masquerading in a gaudy cotton
frock and mittens.</p>

<p>No, no, the whole thing was too much like a burlesque!
Bobby—she had heard of him—was once
more imagining himself behind the footlights, and
playing a part. She made a violent effort, and
dragged away her hand.</p>

<p>“I think your high spirits run away with you, Mr.
Lovett,” she said stiffly. “I forgive you for your
joke—but I really cannot suffer you to take any further
liberties. Let me advise you to resume your own
identity—and to cut your cable without <i>delay</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>Bobby flushed to the roots of his rust-coloured hair;
he gulped down something in his throat, and said:</p>

<p>“I know quite well that I deserve to be put in irons.
I’m thinking of Edgar, and how I’ve damaged his
cause—acted as a first-class, double-armour-plated
destroyer. Won’t you give me one word—half a
word?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not—pray why should I?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” again seizing her hand. “When
you called this afternoon I peeped at you and Mrs.
Lawrence through a hole in the purdah.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did you, indeed!” she said, becoming as red
as a rose. “What a nice gentlemanly thing to do!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I just ‘took an observation,’ as we say. I
saw your sister looking at the books and prints. You
came to the writing-table, directly under my eye;
there was a pile of Edgar’s new photographs on it—just
unpacked. They are rather ripping, I’ll allow.
You took up one and gazed at it, and then—ahem!—when
no one was looking you put it to your lips—you
know you did—you kissed him!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lawrence at this moment stood in one of the
many doorways, and beheld a red-haired boy in petticoats
sitting close to her sister, holding her hand in a
tight grip, and speaking with forcible emphasis.</p>

<p>She caught the words, “You kissed him!” and
poor Ida’s face was scarlet.</p>

<p>The lady paused, dropped the screen quietly, and
crept cautiously away, marvelling much at what she
had heard and seen.</p>

<p>“Oh, you <i>odious</i> boy!” exclaimed Miss Dacre
angrily.</p>

<p>“Yes, you may think me as odious as they make
’em, and call me any name you jolly well please, as
long as you are nice to Edgar.”</p>

<p>“If you ever tell him——” she began in a choked
voice, “if you ever——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“I swear on my solemn word of honour, as an
officer in his Majesty’s Navy, that I never, never will.
Is it Pax?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so—but, remember, I bind myself to
nothing.”</p>

<p>Bobby stooped, in his best dramatic style, and
bowed over her hand—which he released. Then he
stood up and looked about for his hat, which he put
on, stuffing the wig in his pocket.</p>

<p>“My train goes at seven o’clock,” he announced,
“and I must be off. Will you give me a bit of a note
so that Edgar and I may part friends?”</p>

<p>“I never came across such a boy!” she declared,
as she moved to the writing-table.</p>

<p>Bobby watched her as she scribbled a few lines.
Miss Ida was uncommonly handsome, and had a
lovely little straight nose and long eyelashes. So she
was fond of Edgar after all!</p>

<p>“There, will this do?” she asked, holding it out.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Lovett</span>,</p>

<p>“Your brother has just been here, and explained the
situation. I have forgiven him, and I hope you will do
the same. My sister will be very pleased if you will dine
with us this evening, at eight o’clock.</p>

<p class="right">“Yours sincerely, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br>
“<span class="smcap">Ida Dacre</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Yes,” exclaimed Bobby, “that is all right. But,
I say—what a cram about your sister!”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” coolly responded the lady, putting
the note into an envelope, “not at all; she is always
pleased to see your brother. Now here is the note.
I hope,” with an ironical smile, “you have got <i>all</i>
you want?”</p>

<p>“No, not <i>yet</i>—I want something else.”</p>

<p>As she stared at him interrogatively, he suddenly
bent forward and kissed her audibly on the cheek, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
before Miss Dacre had recovered from her astonishment
at his audacity, Bobby was already in the gharry,
waving wildly from the window as he rattled away.</p>

<p>The next time Mr. R. Lovett appeared in Munser,
it was to enact the responsible <i lang="fr">rôle</i> of best man—which
part he played with the most commendable decorum.</p>

<p>The Lawrence family, and one or two others, were
in the secret of “Miss Ruby Scarlett”—but the
station, when hard up for a topic, still discourses of
the mysterious, mad French lady who invaded the
collector’s bungalow, and then disappeared. To
Bobby Lovett the whole story was solemnly related by
Mrs. Tompkins, and Bobby as solemnly gave it as his
opinion that the amazing creature who flashed into
the station for two days was a visitant from another
world—possibly from the vast deep!</p>

THE OLD TOWN HOUSE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a certain damp October evening in Dublin, not
very long ago, a tall girl of two and twenty stood by
Nelson’s pillar, obviously awaiting the arrival of a
tram; her threadbare waterproof, and rusty felt hat,
hinted at a low exchequer, and were but a mean accompaniment
to a pair of splendid grey eyes and a brilliant
complexion; in fact, such an attractive and arresting
face was not often to be encountered even in a city
justly celebrated for its pretty women. Tram after
tram arrived, discharged passengers, and departed
crammed to the doors, but still the girl’s friend came
not.</p>

<p>At last “Patience at the foot of a monument” had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
its reward. An active, curly-headed young man
sprang from a still-moving Donnybrook car, and
hastened to join her with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>“I am most frightfully sorry, Bridge,” he began;
“could not get off till now—such a heavy day at the
Bank. I got your note.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right,” she answered cheerfully, “I
just wanted to have a little talk with you about
Granny.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so you said,” he assented, as they turned
out of the crowd, and walked away at a brisk pace in
the direction of Rutland Square.</p>

<p>Denis D’Arcy and Bridget Doyne had known one
another all their lives; their people came from the
same county, and were distantly connected. The
D’Arcys were a military race, and had gained more
glory than gold; the Doynes of Castle Doyne, on the
contrary, owned a vast estate, and were once renowned
for keeping hounds and racehorses, and dispensing
the almost princely hospitality of old times. Both the
D’Arcys and Doynes had come down in the world by
many and painful degrees; their names were almost
forgotten, and their places knew them no more.
These two were the last representatives of the D’Arcy
and Doyne families; one was a bank clerk at a salary
of a hundred and twenty pounds a year; the other lived
with her grandmother, an old lady of eighty, whose
exquisite needlework brought them a little bread and
tea, whilst the girl herself gave sixpenny music-lessons
in their humble neighbourhood, and read the
daily papers to a blind old gentleman, and for her
services received three shillings a week.</p>

<p>In spite of their poor circumstances and shabby
clothes, the young couple presented a surprisingly
contented appearance, as they hurried along through
the soft autumn mist. The pair were engaged, and
deeply in love with one another; the mere fact of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
being together stood for complete, if transitory,
happiness.</p>

<p>“You say that Granny wishes to see me most
particularly,” said D’Arcy; “have you any idea what
it’s about?—has anything extra happened?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Denis, to both your questions. We have
come to an acute financial crisis—that is not new—and
Mr. Eale, the solicitor, has been to call on Gran, and
made himself most odious, and disagreeable. He
threatens all sorts of things.”</p>

<p>“Eale is a ‘shark lawyer’—a rich rascal who gets
his living by money-lending, taking up shady cases,
and grinding the faces of the poor. Granny should
not have anything to do with such a rotter—or let
him inside her doors.”</p>

<p>“I know, and I cannot bear the sight of him,”
replied Bridget. “As to Granny’s door, there is no
real door in a tenement house; and he stalks down
our passage, raps with his stick, and drops in about
once a week. He brought Gran a basket of grapes
the other day—we <i>sold</i> them!”</p>

<p>“Granny should have flung them at his head, and
she would—if she knew as much about him as I do.”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure she knows something of him now;
he came yesterday, and stayed over an hour. I kept
away all the time, and after he had gone I found
Gran crying. Denis,” and she hesitated for a
moment, “it’s terrible to see an old person cry! Oh,
look—here is Mr. Eale coming out of Mountjoy
Square!”</p>

<p>“Talk of the devil—so he is! Ah, he funks meeting
us. See, he has crossed the road, and is going
into one of those houses.”</p>

<p>Mr. Eale was a short, thick-set individual of about
fifty, with heavy brows and a square jaw; he looked
well dressed and prosperous, and walked with a sort
of swaggering strut. He glanced over his shoulder as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
he waited on the doorstep, and threw the young couple
a baleful glare.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Old Mrs. Doyne had known a grave change of
fortune; from mistress of a fine country place she had
sunk by gradual but irresistible forces to two bare
rooms, in what had once been the town house of the
Doynes, and here she eked out a precarious livelihood
with her wonderfully clever fingers. The slow
descent had taken fifty years to accomplish; gradual
and almost imperceptible at first; the latter phase a
breathless rush. Sophia Doyne was a proud woman,
and had taken extraordinary pains to hide her
troubles and whereabouts from her few surviving
friends, who had a vague impression that “Sophy
Doyne and her granddaughter lived somewhere in
England,” or even that the old lady was already
dead!</p>

<p>The family mansion, which was situated in the
neighbourhood of Mountjoy Square, had once upon a
time been one of the finest houses on the north side.
Who would think so, to behold it now! The rusty
area railings were bent and broken, the areas littered
with old hampers, tin cans, and broken crockery; the
hall door stood wide, and half a dozen noisy children
were playing hop-scotch in the great flagged vestibule.
Beyond this, a pair of double doors had once opened
into a smaller hall, but the doors of handsome
mahogany were now in America. A great winding
staircase with shallow stone steps led up to the drawing-rooms—from
which now descended an overpowering
odour of bad tobacco, and fried herrings. The
walls of both halls and staircase were of stucco, very
dirty and discoloured, but an exquisite frieze still
survived, and gave an impression of processions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
beautifully modelled classical figures—mostly in a
condition of unassuming nudity!</p>

<p>Miss Doyne and her companion did not ascend to
the first floor, but turned into a long flagged passage—papered
with a hideous stone-grey pattern—out of
which opened several rooms. In the first of these,
Mrs. Doyne was discovered seated at a large
mahogany table which was strewn with skeins of silks
and ragged paper patterns. By the light of an old-fashioned
lamp, she was busily engaged in embroidering
an exquisite tea-cloth in various shades of blue.</p>

<p>As she raised her eyes, when the door opened, it
was pitiful to see their faded colour, and red-rimmed
lids—the toll of work and tears. A cap of real lace
crowned her white hair, and a little knitted shawl was
closely drawn round her bent shoulders. The old
lady was woefully small and shrunken, but she had
delicate features, and, for all her squalid surroundings,
a certain air of distinction.</p>

<p>“Oh, Denis,” she exclaimed, “I’m mighty glad
to see you. Take off your coat and warm yourself.”
Then, looking over her shoulder, “Faith, I forgot;
there’s no fire! We are a bit short of coal, and I
can’t stand the smell of that oil stove—though it boils
a kettle. Biddy, my heart, will you go and get tea,
and make us a bit of toast at the end of the passage?
That is, as you know,” to D’Arcy, “our kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Shall I lend a hand?”</p>

<p>“No, no, you stay with me, Denis; you’ll only
hinder her. Biddy’s a grand maid-of-all-work, since
poor Peggy died.”</p>

<p>“Poor Peggy!—she must have been a great age—though
she always looked the same, as long as I can
remember.”</p>

<p>“That’s only six and twenty years, and Peggy was
over ninety; she was active to the last, but her mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
was gone—she could not remember anything, except
what happened fifty years ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Bridget, “and she was always
telling us that somewhere or other there was what was
called ‘a power of money’ in this house!”</p>

<p>“A house as bare as a picked bone,” said Mrs.
Doyne; “but Bridgie, my dear, why are you not
getting the tea?”</p>

<p>As soon as she had left the room, the old lady put
down her work, and, looking at Denis over her spectacles,
said:</p>

<p>“That Eale man has been coming here pretty often
lately with one excuse or other.”</p>

<p>“So I’ve heard. What does he want?”</p>

<p>“He wants to marry Bridget.”</p>

<p>“What!” shouted D’Arcy.</p>

<p>“Yes, he made me a regular formal offer, sitting
there in the same chair just where you are now. He
said he could give his wife a fine house out on Lansdowne
Road, and a motor—and make me a liberal
allowance.” She paused.</p>

<p>“And what did <i>you</i> say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. It takes a good deal now to make me
laugh, but I laughed till I nearly choked, and couldn’t
speak; at last I said, ‘So this is the reason of your
visits, and the presents of grapes.’ He nodded quite
at his ease. ‘Do you know who my granddaughter
is?’ I asked, and he said:</p>

<p>“‘Oh yes, a girl without a second gown to her
back, who gives the greengrocer’s children lessons for
sixpence an hour.’</p>

<p>“‘That’s true,’ I agreed, ‘but she is a Doyne of
Castle Doyne; her grandfather was High Sheriff of
the county.’</p>

<p>“‘And her grandmother does her own washing,’
he put in, as rude as could be.</p>

<p>“‘She does,’ I replied, ‘and your grandmother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
was <i>her</i> kitchenmaid; but this sort of talk is foolish.
My granddaughter is engaged to Mr. D’Arcy—one of
her own class.’</p>

<p>“‘Then she’s a mad fool!’ he roared. He was
furious, and, indeed, so was I. There was not a pin
to choose between us; he said so many hateful things
that at last I told him to go, and never again darken
my doors.</p>

<p>“‘These doors are mine,’ he said, ‘and it is you
who will go—not me. I’ve, as you know, a mortgage
on this old barrack. I’ve not had a penny interest
for two years; it’s a case of five hundred pounds, and
interest, cash down, within a month, or I turn you into
the street, you and your stuck-up lunatic of a granddaughter.’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ I answered, ‘it’s the street for <i>you</i> to-day,’
and I got up and curtsied him out.”</p>

<p>“That was all right.”</p>

<p>“He will pay me back. I saw it in his face.
Within four weeks I’ll have no home, for where am
I to get five hundred pounds?” and she cast her
eyes round the room, which was not large, but lofty,
well-proportioned, and furnished with a few chairs, a
decrepit sideboard, and black horsehair sofa.</p>

<p>“I stripped the house soon after we came here six
years ago. I sold every mortal thing I could sell, to
a dealer, I was so hard-set for ready money. The
mahogany doors in the hall, dining-room, and upstairs,
the two beautiful marble chimney-pieces in the
drawing-room, the door-plates, and the French
mirrors let into the walls between the windows; the
whole place was terribly hacked and knocked about.
Now there is nothing left; I’ve come to the end of
everything, my dear boy. You know our circumstances
just as well as I do myself—how my husband’s
grandfather lived like a king, and got his wine and his
furniture from France, and drove four horses. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
was an attaché in Paris as a young man, and spoke
French like a native. The next Doyne fell on worse
times, and his mother Madame lived here in shameless
extravagance and debt. After she died, the
furniture was sold and the house let, till the north
side went down, and this, and many another fine
mansion, were left to rats and ruin.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true, and more’s the pity.”</p>

<p>“When I was a bride at Castle Doyne I had my
carriage, and a houseful of servants, but we found
debts, and mortgages, and heavy jointures, small
rents, and bad times; it was all we could do to educate
Bridget’s father, and get him into the Army. He
went to India, and then he married a girl without a
penny, and they died and left me the child—and here
I am, an old blind pauper.”</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake stop your eternal needle,”
said the young man suddenly. “Do give your poor
eyes a rest. I can’t bear to see you sewing so hard,
and always sewing.”</p>

<p>“There will soon be an end,” she replied, spreading
out the embroidered border. “This is my last
piece; and here is what I’m coming to, and why I want
to talk to you privately. You told me you had a
good chance of a post, as cashier in an Indian bank;
they would pay your passage out, and give a much
better salary?”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, Denis, you must accept, and marry
Bridget, and take her away with you. She’s a clever
manager, and will make one rupee go as far as two.
You are both young, and have, I hope, many happy
years before you.”</p>

<p>“And what about you?”</p>

<p>The old lady suddenly laid down her work, and,
leaning over the table, whispered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“Don’t be horrified—I shall go into the North
Dublin Union.”</p>

<p>“Never! never! never!” he rejoined, with
emphasis.</p>

<p>“Hush—yes, I shall! What does it matter?
Who will know? If old Peg was alive it would be
different. I dared not have taken her there—she’d
feel it. Now <i>my</i> feelings are dead. I’m old; my
race is run. I’ve outlived my contemporaries, and the
only thing I really and truly care for is Bridget’s
future—and yours.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose we should be happy out in
India, knowing we had deserted you, and left you in
a poor-house! Come, now—do you?”</p>

<p>“I won’t be a clog——”</p>

<p>Whatever she was about to add was interrupted by
the sound of a muffled kick on the door. D’Arcy
sprang to open it, and admitted Bridget looking rather
flushed, and carrying the tea-things on a battered
black tray.</p>

<p>“Oh, such a job to make the kettle boil!” she
announced, setting it down. “What have you two
been plotting?” and she looked from one to the
other.</p>

<p>“Your Granny’s plans,” replied the young man
mendaciously. “If she is turned out from here, there
are two rooms to let in my diggings in Lower
Gardiner Street—cheap, too, and a fine old wreck of a
house, next a pawnbroker’s—if you won’t mind
that?”</p>

<p>“Not at all—it would be mighty convenient,” rejoined
the old lady, with a shrill laugh. “But rooms
cost money. Here I’ve been rent free; so have my
tenants upstairs; they tell me they cannot pay anything,
and are just keeping soul and body together
like ourselves—and I have not the heart to evict
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Who are they? They seem a pretty big crowd.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s a car-driver in the drawing-rooms;
he has six children; above that, there’s a charwoman
and her paralysed daughter. In the back rooms
there’s an old sweep.—Eale will make a grand
clearance.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that he can move either you or
them,” said D’Arcy; “the mortgage must be looked
into. I have a friend, a clever young solicitor, and
he will examine the whole business; if the worst
happens, you come to my diggings. The old woman
is a good sort, and will make you comfortable; we will
scrape along somehow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Denis, my dear boy, do you think I’d live
on you?”</p>

<p>“If only I was not so suspiciously shabby,” broke
in Bridget, “I’d get a situation as governess. Where
I am is all right, as my poor old man is stone-blind.
If I had even three or four pounds I’d invest it in a
sort of personal advertisement, but Granny and I are
owed what, to us, is quite a lot of money, and we dare
not dun for fear of losing our customers. There’s a
shop in London that owes me money since last June—I
suppose they imagine we work for pleasure?”</p>

<p>“Pleasure!” repeated D’Arcy, and he rose, and,
with gentle decision, took the piece of linen out of
the old lady’s hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, to see your Granny you would think so; she
won’t leave it—even to have a cup of tea.”</p>

<p>“Well, Denis, as you are behind the scenes, I may
tell you that I’ve only three and sixpence in the wide
world. I’ve sold the teaspoons, and my mother-in-law’s
miniature—she was a beauty, I’ll say that for
her!—I got three pounds for it in Frederick Street.”</p>

<p>“And no doubt it was worth fifty.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, buying is one thing, selling another.
The dealer said miniatures were out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
fashion, and a glut in the market—but he took it to
oblige me. He was the same fellow who bought the
white marble mantlepieces—they came from Florence,
and had beautifully sculptured figures—he gave me
ten pounds for the pair.”</p>

<p>“My blind old gentleman takes a surprising
interest in this house,” said Bridget; “he remembers
hearing of old Madame Doyne, and her extravagance,
burning wax candles, even in the kitchen, and keeping
three men-servants, and her china and silver a
wonder; also her <i>debts</i>.”</p>

<p>“Which she staved off with sales of the Doyne
heirlooms,” said her daughter-in-law, “though she
was always more for buying than selling. She put
the finishing stroke to the ruin of the family—for she
was a gambler, and loved cards.”</p>

<p>A cup of tea and buttered toast had revived the old
lady, and when Bridget carried out the tray she
whispered to D’Arcy that she would put <i>that</i>—meaning
the union—at the back of her mind for a
week or two, till she saw how things were shaping;
something might turn up.</p>

<p>For the next few days there were further anxious
conferences between D’Arcy and his <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>; the
mortgage had been examined, and, unfortunately,
proved to be in order. This was the news he brought
to Bridget, as they stood together in the flagged
passage after he had taken leave of her grandmother.</p>

<p>“When I think of the hundreds of pounds’ worth
that have been sold out of this house for a mere song,
I feel nearly crazy. I was telling Lynch of those
fine marble chimney-pieces; he wishes he had seen
them. He knows a good deal about such things, and
is mad after old furniture.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing left but the house itself,” said
Bridget, “only the bare walls.”</p>

<p>“And what thickness!” said D’Arcy, striking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
papered passage with his open hand; “as solid as the
rock of Cashel! By Jove—no! the wall is hollow. I
say, Biddy!”</p>

<p>“What do you say?”</p>

<p>“That I believe there’s a door or something here,”
passing his fingers up and down, “Just feel!”</p>

<p>“There can’t be a door,” she objected, “for there
is no room at the other side.”</p>

<p>“Well, there is something. I’ll scrape off a bit of
the paper and see,” and, as he spoke, he produced a
pen-knife, and began to make an incision.</p>

<p>“Wood!” he exclaimed. “Bridgie, there’s more
in this than meets the eye,” and he looked at her
eagerly; “a door papered up.”</p>

<p>“But that’s nothing—it’s a common thing.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so, but I have an idea. I cannot do anything
now, it’s too late, and the light is bad, but
I’ll be here to-morrow at eight, and I’ll strip this
door, if you don’t mind?”</p>

<p>“Mind!” she repeated, “as if we did not <i>sell</i>
doors! But I’m awfully afraid you will have your
trouble for nothing. However, I’ll make you a cup
of tea, and be here to help you.”</p>

<p>“Not a word to Granny—yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, she never gets up till ten o’clock. She
can work in bed as well as anywhere—and it saves a
fire. Oh, if I could only put an end to her stitch,
stitch, stitch; but she <i>will</i> do it, and, in spite of her
old eyes, her work is exquisite; mine is nothing like
so fine—or so saleable!”</p>

<p>By eight o’clock the next morning D’Arcy was
hard at work. Bridget damped the paper, which was
gradually peeled off, and revealed a door—a locked
door.</p>

<p>D’Arcy shook it gently, then violently; the result
was a rattling and jingling within, and he exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“A cupboard—not a door. I’ll run out and borrow
a bunch of old keys.”</p>

<p>After much humouring and buttering—oil not being
obtainable—a key yielded, and a door, which had
been closed for eighty years, opened with a reluctant
creak.</p>

<p>The first discovery was a thin layer of grey dust,
the next a vast collection of silver, glass, and china;
the shelves were crowded. Bridget gave a stifled
scream, and Denis recognised that they had come
upon a wonderful treasure-trove.</p>

<p>“Why, it must be Madame’s green Sèvres, that
Granny talks about—Louis the Sixteenth gave it to
great grandfather Doyne, when he was in Paris; it’s
worth thousands.” And Bridget took Denis by the
arm and shook him. “Think of it—<i>thousands</i>!”</p>

<p>“Easy, easy, Bridge, or I’ll drop a thousand!
There seems to be no end of stuff here; that crafty old
Madame hid all these valuables before her death, and
left no sign.”</p>

<p>“Not as far as we know. Now I’ll fetch the tray,
and we will carry everything into the parlour, and set
them out, and then call Granny; she won’t believe
her poor dear old eyes!”</p>

<p>It took a considerable time to empty the precious
cupboard, but at last the whole of its contents were
arranged on the round table, the sideboard, and the
lesser objects in imposing rows along the floor.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Doyne caught sight of this surpassing
display, she stood for some moments stunned and
speechless.</p>

<p>“Well, this splendid find of yours, Denis, has
come in the nick of time; instead of beggars, we shall
all be well-to-do—if not rich!”</p>

<p>“And you shall never take a needle in your hand
again, Gran,” said the girl, seizing her round the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
waist, “and shall have a sable coat, and a motor-car.”</p>

<p>“Let us see what there is, before you talk of motorcars,”
she said, peering about among the silver and
china. “Yes—this is the green Sèvres set; that alone
will support us; and here is the old Nankin china,
very rare, and a lot of square-marked Worcester,”
turning it over. There were also half a dozen fine
Jacobean wine-glasses, with appropriate mottoes, a
quantity of Queen Anne and Georgian silver, a
Charles I. goblet, and other articles too numerous to
specify—in short, the heirlooms of the Doynes.</p>

<p>For more than an hour the happy trio could do
nothing but exclaim, handle, wonder, and admire;
several of the treasures had a history which had
reached their present owner, and on these she expatiated
with eloquence and gesture.</p>

<p>“Now let us be practical,” said D’Arcy at last;
“I must go to the bank—I’m hours late as it is. I’ll
get hold of Lynch, and bring him up this afternoon,
for I’ll ask for a day off; he will tell us what to do,
find a valuer, and put most of these valuables on
the London market. Meanwhile, leave them just as
they are, and let no one see them, or put a foot in
this room!”</p>

<p>Capable Mr. Lynch soon put matters in train, and
proved an invaluable adviser; he was a long-headed
man of business, with a critical and cultivated taste.
Ultimately, the contents of the wonderful cupboard
brought in a substantial fortune; the Doyne heirlooms
were sold, and scattered far afield. Most of
the chief prizes, including the Sèvres service, followed
the mahogany doors across the Atlantic; the mortgage
on the old house was promptly settled; it has been
altered into a mansion of flats, for Mrs. Doyne and
her family have deserted the north side, and live in
a pretty country place, within easy reach of Dublin.</p>

THE FIND</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the luxurious private sitting-room of a well-known
family hotel not far from Piccadilly, a broad-shouldered
elderly man stood with his hands in his
pockets, staring out of the window with an expression
of profound boredom. It was a hopelessly wet afternoon
and there was not much to see—a taxi discharging
two ladies at the hotel entrance, a clumsy mail-van
thundering by, and a newspaper boy screaming
“All the winners!”</p>

<p>In one respect the individual in the window represented
“a winner”; thirty years in Canada had
brought him great possessions—whatever he touched
seemed to turn into gold. Probably he was the
wealthiest guest in the hotel, and yet the most
supremely discontented. In spite of his fifty years,
his figure was spare and erect, his hair powdered
with white was thick and curly; his features were
well cut, his face clean-shaven, and he wore a blue
serge lounge suit with the air of a man accustomed to
employing a first-class tailor.</p>

<p>Such was Leonard Harling, one of the most important
and influential residents in his province.
Mrs. Harling, a clever looking but faded little
matron, was seated on the edge of a Chesterfield, knitting
a silk sock. She was a woman who never
lounged, was indifferent to outlay and luxury, preferred
a bus to a taxi, and wore, when possible, ready-made
gowns. On the other hand, her charities ran
into amazing figures.</p>

<p>Now and then she raised her eyes, and gazed sympathetically
at her companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“Poor Lenny,” she said to herself, “he is wishing
himself back at home, in great big spacious Canada—where
life and everything is free, and on a large
scale.”</p>

<p>Apparently dress offered no snare to this little lady;
her green costume was plain and tasteless, she wore
no dainty finishing touches, no string of pearls, and
her rather ugly hands merely displayed a plain wedding-ring.
Mrs. Harling had no flair for spending
money on personal adornment, she had been brought
up under a strictly economical rule; her husband, on
the contrary, was reared in the lap of luxury. Here
is his history.</p>

<p>His grandfather, Sir Peregrine Harling, whose
tastes were boundlessly selfish and extravagant, had
lived for years on family prestige, credit, and pretensions.
He maintained and educated the orphan
sons of his heir—Humphrey and Leonard. The
former, who was brilliantly clever, distinguished himself
at Oxford; the latter, who was dull, but shone in
games, was still at Harrow, when the sword fell. Sir
Peregrine died in a fit of apoplexy—caused, it was
said, by an unpleasant letter—and after an imposing
funeral, and when he had been laid to rest on his
shelf in the great family vault, it was discovered that
Sir Peregrine’s affairs were in a hopeless condition;
the Hall and estates were mortgaged to the chimneys,
debts poured in, and creditors—long terrorised by
this arrogant magnate—now clamoured for immediate
payment.</p>

<p>There was a great and prolonged sale, the contents
of the family place, the library, pictures, and plate
were scattered over three counties, and a millionaire
coal king bought the home of the submerged Harlings.
To the widowed Lady Harling there remained an
insignificant annuity, and a few small spars from the
fatal wreckage. She never rallied from the shock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
occasioned by this sudden descent from riches to
poverty, but lived long enough to make arrangements
for the future of her two grandsons. For
clever Humphrey, her favourite, she found an opening
on the staff of a Colonial Governor, and gave him
the price of her jewels in solid cash. As for good-looking,
stupid Leonard, he was packed off to
Canada with two hundred pounds, and a letter of
introduction in his pocket. To save expense, his
passage was taken second-class, in a cheap liner; this
proved in the long run to have been a most unwise
economy. Leonard Harling, his own master at
twenty, king of his company, with a well-lined pocket,
and the world as he believed before him, lost his head,
and so to speak his senses! He talked loquaciously
of his affairs—his outfit, and guns, and money—to
hard-headed insidious ruffians who posed as his counsellors
and sympathetic friends.</p>

<p>He learnt to play poker and to lose money like a
gentleman. Here he was cautious, and did not exceed
twenty pounds. At Montreal his companions
introduced him to a small evil-smelling hotel in a low
quarter, and after a night’s wild conviviality he woke
to find himself, not like Byron, “famous,” but
robbed of his all! Money, guns, portmanteau had
vanished; what to him remained was one five-pound
note, and a kit-bag. Even his letter of introduction
was gone, and he could not remember the name and
address of the man who was to have given him “a
lift.” The thieves were never traced, and indeed
some supposed that Leonard’s story was a clumsy invention;
if he <i>would</i> put up at a low tavern, and drink
rye whisky and gamble, he got what he deserved!</p>

<p>No, his new acquaintances were neither friendly
nor helpful, and he dared not write home and
announce his loss; for well he knew he would get no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
help from his austere old grandmother, who would
say:</p>

<p>“Just what I expected from stupid Leonard!”</p>

<p>Penniless and a stranger, stupid Leonard was
obliged to exert all his energies in order to earn his
daily bread. First he had a job on the railway, then
he drove a traction plough on a farm, finally he was
engaged as an assistant to a blacksmith. He contrived
to keep his head above water, and so five years
passed.</p>

<p>Leonard Harling was active, honest, and hard-working,
but he had no initiative, push, or self-assertion,
and he had never risen beyond the grade of
manual labour, until he came across Lizzie Aitken.
Within twenty miles of where he worked, a flourishing
town was holding a week’s festivities. There
were to be dances, cricket, and sports, and for this
Leonard and two young men, his mates, took a whole
holiday. As an accomplished athlete, the handsome,
well-knit young Englishman carried off the most
coveted prizes—the one-mile race, hurdle race, and
high jump—all fell to Leonard Harling! He wore
his school colours, and made an attractive figure in his
jersey, shorts, and shoes—relics of old Harrow days,
which he had clung to, whatever his difficulties. This
graceful, dark-eyed stranger was watched with unusual
interest by all the young women present.</p>

<p>Among these was Lizzie Aitken—the beauty and
heiress of Tolputt. Her father, the son of a Scotch
shepherd, had come out to Canada, a canny hard-bitten
laddie, and steadily worked his way up rung
by rung; he was now rich, and the mayor of the
town, and his only child Lizzie, a pretty red-haired
lassie, was the apple of his eye. She had received a
fair education, could dance, embroider, play the
piano, and cook; and it was his intention that, with
her fine dowry, Lizzie should make a really splendid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
match—aye, and keep her carriage and servants, and
live in style.</p>

<p>Lizzie became acquainted with young Harling at a
ball. He wore, beside his recent laurels, an air of
distinction—a romantic glamour surrounded this
good-looking English visitor.</p>

<p>In comparison to the local swains, he had an
assured ease, a charming manner—he might be a
prince in disguise. Lizzie invited him to her home,
where, appearances being in his favour, he was well
received by her parent, and a week passed like a
summer day. The love affair blazed up between the
young people, but was ruthlessly quenched by old
Aitken when he discovered that “the Prince,” as he
was nicknamed, was only the hired help of Job
Mackay, the blacksmith over by Lomax.</p>

<p>In spite of enormous difficulties, the couple corresponded,
met, and finally eloped. They went out
West, and for the first year their lines were laid in
thorny places; but by dint of courage and industry
they managed to hold out and make a living.</p>

<p>Lizzie, who was practical, clever, and energetic, remembered
words of wisdom which had fallen from
her father’s lips, respecting their retreat.</p>

<p>“A great future awaits Saint Largo in a few years
time, though it’s a miserable hole <i>now</i>. It will be a
golden city; it has a lake, and wonderful possibilities
for trade; when it gets the railway it is <i>made</i>!”</p>

<p>With this prophecy ever in her mind, Lizzie Harling
took hold. She started a sort of cheap restaurant
in her rough and draughty shack, and as she was a
born cook, and a thrifty manager, the “hotel” paid.
Besides the hotel, she undertook the post-office, and
the business of newsagent to the community. Everyone
agreed that “Missis Harling” was “real smart,”
and Leonard, her husband, realised that if he had no
fortune with his Lizzie, she represented a priceless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
treasure. For his part he set up a smithy, and kept
a good team of horses, which he hired out for freight
and farm work—and presently the Harlings began to
prosper. The one cloud on their happiness was the
loss of two small children—an empty cradle represented
their tragedy.</p>

<p>As time advanced, all the hard-earned numerous
dollars were invested in land in and around Saint
Largo, and when at last the railway came, it brought
them fortune. The Harlings no longer occupied a
shack; Leonard had built his wife a fine solid brick
house; the furniture hailed from Toronto, and included
a piano and cheval glass. He urged her to
spend money, to buy smart clothes and jewellery, and
enjoy life “like other women.” But she laughed,
and protested at his extravagance, and said:</p>

<p>“I’ve got out of the way of shopping. The
greatest pleasure I really enjoy is sitting hand-idle in
my rocker, listening to the hired girl washing up the
dishes and saucepans, which was my own job for
twelve years.”</p>

<p>About this time, old Aitken, who had forgiven the
successful couple, died, and left his only child a large
and well-invested fortune, and the Harlings were the
richest and most influential people in a bustling,
prosperous place that now called itself a city. After
considerable hesitation they decided on a trip to the
Old Country, where Leonard endeavoured to trace his
brother—of whom he had lost sight for years.</p>

<p>Humphrey remained in Australia, and wrote from
there at long intervals, and then all letters had ceased.
The family lawyer whom Leonard interviewed informed
him that his brother had married in Melbourne,
and not very long afterwards he died. What
had happened to the widow or children—if any—he
could not say.</p>

<p>Subsequently Leonard took his wife to visit what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
had been the home of his ancestors; and the result of
this excursion (as is sometimes the case) was disappointing.
Twenty years had effaced many old
friends, memories, and landmarks; the ancient family
was forgotten.</p>

<p>Now, after a lapse of another ten years, the Harlings
were once more in London, and had spent three
months in this hotel, pretending to one another that
they were having the time of their lives. They did
a round of theatres, operas, pictures, dinners at restaurants,
and stiff dinners with business people who
desired to be civil to the Canadian millionaire. They
themselves entertained various Canadian acquaintances
and fellow-passengers, but they had no relatives
or intimates, and all the time felt themselves to be
strangers in a strange land.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Presently Leonard Harling turned away from the
window, picked up a paper and sat down. His wife
watched him surreptitiously; he was reading the
advertisements—anything to pass the time! He did
not belong to a club, he did not play bridge, he did
not enjoy idleness. When his companion heaved an
involuntary sigh he looked up and said:</p>

<p>“Say, Lizzie, I believe we made a bad shot coming
over this time. We seem a bit out of the picture—and
everything is so confoundedly slow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, one misses the whirl at home—the Committee
Meetings, and the big house and gardens, and
neighbours—and the dogs.”</p>

<p>“We have no special deep-down-rooted interests—that’s
what ails us.”</p>

<p>“Well anyhow, you have your grand collection,
Len, your silver,” and Mrs. Harling waved a knitting-needle
at a row of priceless tankards, that shone
on a cabinet between the windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“Silver, yes—it’s just a hobby; but there’s nothing
to it; it amuses me, and circulates the coin.
What I miss is a live, human interest.”</p>

<p>“I know,” and she nodded, “such as a son or a
daughter. Yes, I’d be thankful to go back to dish-washing,
cooking, and slavery, for that.”</p>

<p>“Now would you, Lizzie? Well, I must confess I
could not help envying the party last night at the
next table—father, mother, two pretty daughters, son
in the Guards, and friend—what a cheery lot they
were; so gay and genial and happy.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity we could never trace your brother’s
widow.”</p>

<p>“I expect she’s out in Australia. I wrote to
Humphrey after we were married, and he sent me a
lecture as a wedding-present. He was no longer at
Government House; but he did not mention his job.
I say, you know we dine early, and have stalls at the
Haymarket, so you’d better go and dress, and I’ll
run down and look at the tape.”</p>

<p>Leonard Harling was a well-known collector and
authority on old silver; his name was frequently
quoted in articles, he was a personage of importance
in sale rooms, and catalogues pursued him wherever
he went. What he enjoyed and delighted in was to
poke about among dingy little antiquary shops or
pawn-offices. A window full of what looked like
rubbish invariably held his attention, and more than
once he had picked up a prize.</p>

<p>One afternoon he and his wife were staring into a
mixed collection in a pawnbroker’s in Soho. Here
were strings of coral, scraps of old lace, bits of china,
spotted prints, and a few battered watches, and teapots.</p>

<p>“Do you see that sugar-bowl?” said Mrs. Harling.
“Black—possibly pewter—but a nice old shape.”</p>

<p>“Yes, how sharp you are, Liz. You mean the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
full of glass beads. I’ll just go in and have a look
at it.”</p>

<p>The shop was squalid and common, and evidently
traded with the really poor; clothes and boots were
piled up within, and there was also an assortment of
cheap clocks and umbrellas. The assistant, a young
Hebrew with glossy hair, wore many rings, and from
the private premises came an appetising smell of fried
fish.</p>

<p>“The sugar-bowl?” he repeated, reaching for it.
“Yes; oh, it’s silver all right,” and he polished it
with a cloth. “See, it’s Georgian, but not for sale,
I think. A fine piece—the young fellow might be
tempted—I fancy he’s hard up,” and he handed it
over, and Leonard Harling assumed his pince-nez.
First he examined the marks—all right; then the
crest. His hand shook a little when he recognised
his own!—the torch and crown—and, like a flash, he
seemed to remember this very sugar-bowl in the blue-veined
hand of his grandmother.</p>

<p>“Who does it belong to?” he enquired.</p>

<p>“We cannot give names of our clients,” was the
pompous reply.</p>

<p>“Not if it is in their interest—and—er—yours?”
and Harling touched his pocket with significance.
The salesman hesitated, relaxed his attitude and
said:</p>

<p>“I’ll go and look up the book,” and he left them.</p>

<p>“Lizzie, I’ve a clue—this sugar-bowl you spotted!
It’s got the family crest, and I believe it came from
Humphrey. We’ll find out who pawned it—of course
it’s an off-chance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I’ve the address,” said the assistant,
returning: “‘P. Harling, 5, Russell Buildings,
W.C.’—workmen’s flats. The article is pawned for
one pound—it’s worth twenty. I see you know
something of its quality.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“Do you think you could manage for me to interview
the owner. What is he like?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a young chap—gentlemanly—shabby. I
only saw him after dark.”</p>

<p>“Can you, as a great favour, ask him to meet me
here, or elsewhere?”</p>

<p>“I’ll see what I can do; it’s a bit unusual, you
know.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll do your best. Here is my card, and
telephone to the hotel. Write to-night; be as slick as
you can—you’ll find it will be worth your while.”</p>

<p>“I think we may be on the trail, Liz,” he said, as
they walked away. “No harm in seeing P. Harling.
If he looks a dissipated ruffian—so much the worse;
but if he’s my relative I’ll give him a leg up. We
may know by to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>At seven o’clock the next evening, the landing
waiter informed Mr. Harling that a young man had
called to see him, but did not give his name.</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, in the hall, sir; I think he’s a clerk from
some place of business.”</p>

<p>“Show him up here.”</p>

<p>The instant Harling’s eyes fell on the well-set-up
but shabby stranger, he was struck by the amazing
likeness to his brother. Undoubtedly this stranger
was his nephew! Nevertheless he began his enquiries
with caution, as he motioned him to a seat,
and said:</p>

<p>“I’ve an idea that you may be able to tell me something
of a relative who died in Melbourne. His
name was Humphrey Harling.”</p>

<p>“It was my father’s name,” calmly responded the
visitor. Then by degrees—for Humphrey’s son was
inclined to be stiff and reserved—Harling extracted
all the information he required. His brother, who
had inherited the family failing, got into serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
money difficulties; he married a fashionable dressmaker,
who supported him. They had two children—twins,
boy and girl. He was killed in a street accident,
and his widow brought the twins to England,
partly for education, and partly in the hope of finding
her husband’s people. She too fell on evil days, but
made at her trade sufficient to educate her children
and keep a roof over her head. Now she was gone
the twins lived together; he was a clerk to a stock-broker,
and she a typist in a bank. Just at present
Lily was ill, recovering from diphtheria, and they
had been obliged to pawn one or two things.</p>

<p>This young man, who had the nose and voice and
self-possession of his race, was astounded when this
inquisitive elderly gentleman came forward with outstretched
hand, and claimed him as his nephew! He
had been under the impression that he wished to buy
the sugar-bowl. What an extraordinary change this
bit of old silver had made in his life, and Lily’s!
She was immediately moving to a nursing home, and
he to quarters in this grand hotel. He was fitted out
by a fashionable tailor, and slipped into his new part
with surprising ease; but all the same, remained a
quiet, unassuming youth, anxious to adapt himself to
his new relatives. He was devoted to his sister, had
a practical turn of mind, and, unless “stupid
Leonard” was mistaken, Peregrine the younger (in
reality Sir Peregrine) had brains!</p>

<p>Leonard Harling and Lizzie his wife were delighted
with their “find”; the girl was so pretty and
sweet-tempered, the boy a really fine young fellow;
and when they returned to their home (of late years
near Hamilton) they carried with them, besides stores
of ancient silver, a wonderful source of new interests,
new hopes, and present happiness—all imported into
their lives by an old crested sugar-bowl.</p>

THE CREAKING BOARD</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bramleigh Place</span>, a fine specimen of an early
Jacobean dwelling, had been in the Millard family for
nearly three centuries, but of late years the Millards
had fallen on evil days. There was no money to
maintain the property in fitting state, the farms were
let, as well as the shooting; graziers rented the park
to the borders of the pleasure ground; the house was
closed, and abandoned to dust and spiders; the garden
was free to weeds and birds. An elderly couple had
been installed in “The Place” as caretakers, but
these looked upon it as nothing more or less than a
lonesome, draughty, inconvenient abode—a whole
mile from the village and a glass of whisky.</p>

<p>Now and then, in summer-time, lodgers at farms,
or in the village, would walk over to the stately old
mansion, and bribe Mrs. Pilcher to show them
around; and she was not inaccessible. Odd shillings,
also the price of tea and bread and butter, made a
nice little addition to her weekly wages. She opened
the tall doors and the heavy shutters, and invited paying
visitors into the great saloon, there to gaze upon
the Bramleigh Vandyke—a handsome cavalier, with
a satin coat and long fair locks—as well as many
other valuable paintings and family portraits by
Reynolds and Lely, old lacquered cabinets and
Chippendale chairs, wonderful settees, card-tables, and
screens. Most of the great lofty rooms were half
empty, for on the bankruptcy of the late Sir Aubrey
Millard there had been a sensational auction, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
residue happened to be heirlooms, and as such,
fixtures; and the house was in the curious condition
of being neither unfurnished nor yet furnished. Mrs.
Pilcher, as she ushered her customers in and out of
apartments, and up and down stairs, related many
surprising tales of the Millards, and gave the house
the reputation of being badly haunted. She was a
clever old body, with a loose tongue and a warm
imagination, and such were her powers of description,
that more than one of her listeners, passing late on
the distant highroad, looked down upon the dignified
Place, standing in a hollow, with a sensation of fearsome
awe.</p>

<p>Young Millard, the owner, was with his regiment
in India; there he made the acquaintance of a wealthy
American family on tour, and subsequently married
the daughter—a charming girl, with a fabulous
fortune. Young Lady Millard fell in love with Bramleigh
at first sight—it was a place after her own
heart!—and she hurried from room to room, exclaiming
in raptures as she made discoveries of pictures,
tapestries, and furniture—hailing these, one by one,
as delightful possessions and priceless treasures.
The prompt and energetic new mistress commanded
that Bramleigh was to be set in order without delay;
the aged Pilchers were dismissed with a pension, and
replaced, first by an army of workmen and upholsterers,
and then by a staff of gardeners, grooms,
and indoor servants. Soon there were horses and
motors in the great empty yard, as well as new stables,
and a garage. The mouldy Justice Room was turned
into a lounge, and long-deserted Bramleigh was
transformed by the enchanted wand, which is known
as “Money.”</p>

<p>Lady Millard and her husband were young, gay,
and popular; they entertained parties for shooting,
cricket, and week-ends, as London was only forty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
miles away; they also were entertained, and frequently
from home—or spending a week or two in town. On
these occasions, the large number of unemployed
servants had ample time to themselves—and Satan
was not idle.</p>

<p>Among the women, Fanny Lappage, second housemaid,
was the ringleader in mischief and fun; moreover,
a remarkably pretty girl and a shameless flirt,
with half the men at her beck and call. For all her
giddiness, she was a first-rate housemaid, and never
shirked work—only for this, the housekeeper would
have dismissed her; she was too flighty, too saucy,
and too pretty; but there never was a better girl for
polishing furniture or turning out a room—and besides,
her ladyship liked Fanny.</p>

<p>Chief among Fanny’s slaves was James Hegan, a
tall, fine-looking footman, Irish by descent, with jet-black
hair, and deep-set dark blue eyes. Naturally
smart, silent, and impassive, he was an admirable
servant—though plagued out of his wits by Fanny
Lappage and her vagaries. She was continually
teasing him, and ridiculing him in the servants’ hall,
or the still-room, and the long stone passages often
echoed with her ringing laugh at Hegan’s expense;
whilst he could only stare stupidly, marvel at her
cleverness, and admire her bewitching little face.</p>

<p>Trail, the butler, and Mrs. Madden, housekeeper,
had often and vainly remonstrated with giddy Fanny—sometimes
she really went too far. By a curious
instinct, she had discovered that Hegan was nervous
and superstitious—on this subject she chaffed him
constantly and mercilessly; yet, strange to say, the
more she flouted and tormented him, the more
ardently he adored her. He was of a naturally silent
and melancholy disposition, and it was Fanny’s
amazing liveliness that appealed to him. As for
superstition—superstition was in his blood (as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
child, he had listened to many a weird tale from the
lips of an Irish grandmother), and this characteristic
was kept alive, and even fanned, by conversations he
overheard at his master’s table whilst he waited automatically—listening
with all his ears.</p>

<p>Lady Millard had imbibed the modern taste for the
occult and psychical speculations; and some of the
experiences he overheard were so vividly described
as to be almost hair-raising. Hegan’s hand shook
as he handed dishes and plates. Certain subjects lay
beyond his mental reach, but one was easily comprehended.
He understood a genial gentleman—a
neighbour—who, with a jovial laugh, remarked:</p>

<p>“I suppose, Lady Millard, you know that you have
something <i>here</i>!—an apparition—and, by all accounts,
it’s pretty bad too; it is——”</p>

<p>Here Lady Millard made a quick little sign, and
then she too laughed, and said something in French,
and the guest replied:</p>

<p>“Oh yes; by Jove!—all right, then—another
time!”</p>

<p>But all the same, the seed had taken root in
Hegan’s mind—“Something” had assumed alarming
and sinister proportions.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The family were yachting at Cowes; it was an unusually
warm and sultry July, and the staff at Bramleigh,
with nothing to do, and an ample allowance
of animal food and beer, felt more or less lazy—not
to say comatose. The visit of Mrs. Pilcher (late
caretaker) effected an agreeable diversion; this old
body was full of stimulating local gossip and housewives’
tales, and always well worth her tea! The
maids encouraged her to talk; they drew her out, and
she entertained them with amazing stories, and “they
says” of the Millard family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“You lived here fifteen year, Mrs. Pilcher,” said
the vivacious Fanny, “and never saw anything worse
nor yourself—eh?—come now! Why, surely there
must be a ghost in a big rambling old place like this?
Don’t you tell <i>me</i> there ain’t!”</p>

<p>“There may be,” rejoined Mrs. “Pil,” nursing
her teacup as she spoke, “but I never went about
after dark. Tom and me allus sat in the library, and
slep’ in the morning-room—us hadn’t the breath for
stairs—and them above rampaged about as they liked;
no need for us an inter-meddling—and them passages
and corridors for wind would skin you alive!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you never <i>see</i> anything?” persisted
Fanny. “Come, now, we’re all friends here.”</p>

<p>“Only rats in plenty—the kitchen was black wid
’em—and them as big as rabbits.”</p>

<p>“Rats like rabbits—but nothing more? Come,
now, Mrs. Pil; surely someone has seen a ghost—try
and remember, and I’ll give you a nice little
present. I do love to hear of horrors.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, Fanny Lappage, since you <i>are</i> so set
on and eager, I did hear summat—summat as was
told me by the folk as was here afore us—and left.”</p>

<p>“Did they see anything? Oh, Jim!” beckoning
to Hegan, “and Rosie, Ethel, and George and Tom—<i>do</i>
come along and listen—it’s awful fun. Mrs.
Pil is going to tell us about the ghost that’s here—she
will make our flesh creep. Won’t it be lovely!”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure,” muttered Jim, turning to Mrs.
Pilcher. “What’s it all about, mother?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pilcher appreciated an audience; she wiped
her mouth deliberately with a spotted handkerchief,
rubbed her hands on her knees, nodded at the circle
which had gathered about her, and cleared her throat.</p>

<p>“You all know the old wing—the long passage,
and the swing-door?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>There was a chorus of “Yes, yes, yes—why, to be
sure!”</p>

<p>“The three big low rooms looking south over the
shrubberies and into the park—main old, they say—well,
it’s <i>there</i>!” and she paused dramatically. Mrs.
“Pil” was a gifted story-teller. “Afore our time”
(she spoke as if they had been deposed sovereigns)
“the caretaker and wife and girl lived in that wing,
as it were warm and convenient. They allowed they
heard walking and talking, but were never properly
frightened, till one hot summer night when the man
was late in the village. There was a full moon, and
it was that stifling they had the doors and windows
open—’twas the middle room, d’ye see? Mother and
girl was a-making ready for bed, and the house locked
up. All of a sudden they fell in a terrible taking, a
sort of fright as threw ’em into a cold sweat—and they
could not say for why, or wherefore; but hot as it was,
they felt like two blocks of ice. Then they heard the
swing-door slam, and someone in high heels come a-pattering
along the passage—nearer and nearer.
There it must be in the doorway, for the floor had a
loose board and creaked. They was awful afraid to
look, as they knew in their bones something not right
was standin’ there, and yet look they had to! And
sure enough, right on the creakin’ board was a lady
in a queer, puffed-out sort of dress, awful old-fashioned.
She had a long, shiny knife in her hand,
and they two felt turned to stone. At the moment
they heard the man below shoutin’ for the key of the
side door, and the wife had just strength to tie it in
her apron and throw it out of the window. Then the
lady went off; they heard her a-patterin’ quick down
the passage, and the swing-door a-slammin’ behind
her. After that, they lived down below—but never
saw her again, nor ever give her a chance, as they
did not venture above after dusk. They say she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
black eyes and looked awful wicked—just set on ill-doing,
but young, and handsome. When the man
died—he was found dead, they do say—the wife and
daughter come away and were thankful—and we took
the place; but if it was my last breath, though I heard
what I heard—I never <i>saw</i> nothing!”</p>

<p>“And so it’s the middle room in the old wing,”
said Fanny briskly. “I know—it has a high
chimney-piece and three windows.”</p>

<p>“Aye, that’s it; and they give out the noises and
the trouble is allus worser in summer-time, and full
o’ the moon, and that whenever you hear a board
creak in these old floors, <i>she</i> is not far off!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pilcher suddenly rose to her feet, shook the
crumbs from her gown, and took leave; she understood
the value of a brief and effective departure.</p>

<p>At supper that evening there was an animated discussion
respecting the creaking board, and the lady
with the shining knife. Fanny, in the wildest spirits,
challenged George, James, Tom, or Mr. Trail himself,
to go and meet the ghost in the middle room—she
even offered them a vague reward. But no one
came forward to pick up her gage, in spite of her
jeers and gibes. The household was, however, profoundly
interested to recognise among the family
portraits in the library the identical lady, as described
by Mrs. Pilcher, with a long thin face, black eyes,
white powdered hair, and a mole on her chin.</p>

<p>The days that followed were dull and drowsy.
Fanny invested all her superfluous energies in incessantly
tormenting James Hegan. At last he became
desperate, and said:</p>

<p>“Well, look here, Fan; as you say the moon is
near the full, it’s summer—now’s my chance for the
ghost! But if I go alone to the middle room in the
oak corridor at twelve o’clock, leave the door open,
and bring your thimble from off the mantelpiece, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
stay there for an hour, you will marry me—come,
now. I’ll go for that—and no less, I swear!”</p>

<p>To this ultimatum Fanny, after much sparring and
giggling, eventually agreed. Jim was a handsome
fellow; though he had no talk, he had more inches
and broader shoulders than anyone in the house—not
to speak of considerable savings.</p>

<p>Sir Eldred and Lady Millard were not expected for
a week, and the ordeal was fixed for a certain day
and hour. Fanny was unusually lively, talkative,
and irresponsible, and all the under-servants were
agog with keen anticipation.</p>

<p>When the great evening arrived, Jim, who was
secretly in a deadly fright (and had fortified himself
with two glasses of beer), was conducted to the swing-door,
and seen off about eleven o’clock by all his
associates, with many jokes, and good wishes for the
success of his adventure. He was too early—his
friends had been so anxious to speed him; he felt a
sense of dull resentment as he pulled the baize door
behind him, walked down the corridor, and entered
the middle room, now flooded by moonlight. First
of all he went over to the chimney-piece and
appropriated Fanny’s dainty little thimble. Then
for a long time he stood by the window gazing on
the sleeping woods, and waiting—for what? he
asked himself. The night air was hot and breathless,
every sound was audible, from the flutter of a bat’s
wings or the hoot of an owl to the far-away barking
of a dog or the hum of a belated motor on the distant
highroad.</p>

<p>Gradually he became aware of a stillness, a chilliness,
and a silence—as if Nature were holding her
breath prior to some prodigious effort. He was also
sensible of a cold sensation of creeping uneasiness,
and began to realise that his Dutch courage had
evaporated, and that he felt sickeningly nervous.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
Tales from his grandmother, and tales from the
dinner-table, invaded his memory, and repeated themselves
with a vividness of detail, and a plausibility
befitting the hour, the locality, and the man.</p>

<p>Yet, so far, nothing had happened! Possibly it
was all nonsense and rot, urged another cheerful
mental voice; his spirits stirred, and rose. But what
was <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>A sudden reckless slamming of the swing-door—yes,
and footsteps—quick, light footsteps, coming
along the corridor! Hegan’s heart flew into his
throat; he felt almost suffocated with terror as he
backed into the window, and stared at the entrance.</p>

<p>But the noise had entirely ceased—ceased for five
immensely long minutes; for ten—there was nothing
to be seen! With an extraordinary sensation of
relief he turned away, leant his elbows on the open
sash, and once more gazed down into the moonlit
park. In ten minutes more he would be free to go!
As he stood listening anxiously for the striking of
the stable clock, his senses were strung to the utmost—his
ears alive to every sound.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard the sharp creaking of a board,
and flung round. She stood in the doorway! A
lady with a powdered head and bunchy petticoats; by
one hand she held a handkerchief to her face, in the
other was a long and glittering knife!</p>

<p>And—she was coming in—she was approaching.
Panic seized upon him, and seemed to gnaw his
knees. In a spasm of mortal fear—the frenzy of the
trapped animal that turns on its destroyer—he
snatched up a heavy old chair. Hegan was a powerful
man—it was as a straw to him in his present
desperation—and he dashed at the figure in a fury of
terror, struck it twice with all his force, and felled it
to the ground.</p>

<p>The thing gave a stifled shriek, and moaned—yes—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
he threw down his weapon, and fled as for his
very life.</p>

<p>When he gained the hall, ghastly and breathless,
he found an eagerly expectant crowd. The first footman,
noticing his face, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Hallo! Jimmy, old boy—you look as if you’d
seen her!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he gasped out, “she was there—knife and
all!”</p>

<p>“And what did you do?”</p>

<p>“I picked up a chair and struck at her, and ran!”
He was still livid and panting for breath.</p>

<p>Several of the women looked at one another significantly,
and at last the cook said:</p>

<p>“Why, James, don’t you know it was all a bit of
a joke?”</p>

<p>“Joke!” he repeated, and his eye travelled
swiftly round the circle, in speechless quest of Fanny.
“Where’s Fanny?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“You’ve just seen her; the ghost was Fanny herself.
We dressed her up, and floured her hair—and——”</p>

<p>“And,” he added in a loud, hoarse voice, “I
believe—I’ve done for her! I—I hit her a terrible
blow! Fanny! Fanny!” he shouted, and he raced
up the stairs, followed by all the inmates of the
Place.</p>

<p>They crowded through the swing-door and
streamed along the passage into the middle room.
There on the floor lay a little dressed-up figure with
a horrible wound in her head—a knife clutched in her
grasp—stone dead!</p>

<p>Nor was this the worst. When Hegan realised
that he had unintentionally killed his pretty, mocking
sweetheart, he kissed her, rose from beside her, and,
before anyone had guessed his intention, sprang on
the sill, hurled himself out of the window, and, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
a crash among branches, fell heavily on the lawn with
a broken neck.</p>

<p>Sir Eldred and Lady Millard, hastily summoned
from Cowes, were horrified to find on their return
home that two of their household lay awaiting an
inquest in the old unused laundry—their fate the
result of a practical joke—and for many months Lady
Millard deserted the Place, and made her home in
Continental hotels.</p>

<p>At Bramleigh the middle room in the oak corridor
has long been closed; but the double tragedy has left
its mark. After dusk, the maids go about in couples;
a creaking board throws them into a paroxysm of
terror, and they snatch at one another, and whisper,
“<i>She’s</i> somewhere about!” for Bramleigh enjoys the
unique reputation of being haunted by the ghost—of
a ghost!</p>

THE SWORD OF LANBRYDE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rusholme Place</span>, a fine old mansion in the Midlands,
is seated in a picturesque and well-wooded park, and
surrounded by the usual accompaniments of lawns,
pleasure-grounds, and gardens. The exterior of
Rusholme, although it presents a most attractive
appearance, is as nothing compared with the treasures
within.</p>

<p>The large entrance hall, and billiard-room, which
opens out of it, are said to be an admixture of the
Natural History and the Victoria and Albert Museums
of South Kensington! The walls of both are covered
with trophies of the chase (their owner was a dead-shot,
and went far afield for sport). A magnificent
bull-moose from Nova Scotia faces a life-like bison,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
late from Southern India; fine heads of deer surmount
the doorways; and along the walls are high glass
cases, containing specimens of rare birds, and small
animals, such as snow-white hares, weasels, etc. This
is the natural history department; there are also displayed
in these rooms inlaid damascened Indian arms;
Afghan guns; old Spanish chairs upholstered in Cordova
leather; a stand of rare books—which include a
beautifully illustrated Koran, picked up on a battlefield.
A wonderful Chinese embroidered curtain
drapes a wall, in front of which stands a table holding
a Russian samovar, and a Japanese incense-burner in
bronze, of the most terrifying description. In the
hall is an ancient carved chest, said to have been
washed ashore from the Spanish Armada. Here are
also several exquisite figures of Grecian type, about two
feet high—these had been dug up on the banks of the
Indus, and were said to have been left behind by the
hosts of Alexander the Great. Wherever you looked
within these two rooms, there was something interesting
to see, but it was at night that—astonishing fact—there
was something interesting to <i>hear</i>.</p>

<p>After the genial party of billiard players had
departed, when the lights were extinguished, the
house closed and buried in silence, the collection from
all parts of the world exchanged experiences—personal
or otherwise, and held discussions—but these
were not always attended with success. The stag
and the tiger had high words; it had been found necessary
to interrupt and silence the stoat and the white
hare. It was considered more prudent to confine the
evening entertainments to the harmless form of story-telling.
The great moose was chairman of the company;
the bison, his <i lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i>, vice-chairman; the
Chinese incense-burner and an Afghan jazail occasionally
interposed remarks, but, on the whole, peace
reigned supreme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“I now call upon the Ferrara Blade,” said the deep
bass of the moose; “let us hear your tale.”</p>

<p>After a moment’s silence, a thin, sharp voice from
a corner began without further preamble: “My story,
good listeners, is ancient history, but it is true. I will
merely relate one incident—no need to more than
touch on my own life, for to tell my adventures would
take hours. I am a well-tempered Andrea Ferrara
blade, married to a Spanish handle of great value.
By chance, I entered a military family, and descended
from father to son. I have seen desperate fighting in
the Low Countries—aye, and in the New World.
After a long time came peace—there was no work
for me, and I was hung up in my scabbard over a
fireplace in the library of the ancient mansion of my
Lord of Lanbryde. His home was right in the north
of Scotland—its lands were lipped by an ocean that
had its further shore in the Arctic Circle. The wind
was fine and strong—the sunsets recalled the tropics;
air and land bred bold fishermen, and big-boned folk,
who held themselves high, and knew not the word
‘fear.’ It was recorded that the race came from the
Danes.</p>

<p>“Blairvie, my Lord, was heir to great estates, a
tall old man, with a high, hooked nose and bushy
brows, a famous swordsman and gamester in his day—which
was over. Now he had nought to do but
mind his property and harry his tenants. He was a
hard landlord—hard to all the world except himself.
Married to a lord’s daughter, he had two children—a
son in a Highland regiment, and one girl. Blairvie
was a tyrant to them, and to everyone within his reach;
he turned out folk from places where they and their
forebears had lived for generations.</p>

<p>“One very old woman crawled to his door and
begged for mercy, but he was as stone. She went
down on her knees, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“‘Blairvie, let me die in my ain wee housie. I
pray you to leave me where I was born and bred—my
time must now be short.’</p>

<p>“But it was all of no use—Blairvie was adamant—so
she uprose, and cursed him to his face.</p>

<p>“‘Ye have ta’en away the land from us, aye, and
from many—ye that has plenty. See now,’ she said,
‘I lay my malison on you: the land will be ta’en
away from you and yours—for ever and ever. Your
descendants will not own a yard of green turf, and will
die beggars!’ and then she fell in a sort of fit, and
was thrown out.</p>

<p>“For some time afterwards there was great talk of
the old witch and her curse, and the ‘wierd’ pronounced
against Blairvie; but by degrees the whole
thing died away. The lands of Lanbryde were fertile,
for much of the soil was old and rich; the sheep,
cattle, and orchards were beyond anything for excellence.
The place, a great big house, square to the
winds, lay back in a bay between two big horns of
shingle—but the whole beach was covered with beautiful
sand, so fine that it could run through an hourglass.</p>

<p>“By gradual degrees, it was noticed that the sea
was encroaching; huge mounds of sands had accumulated—some
of them one hundred feet in height—and
the sand seemed scarcely ever at rest. In strong
westerly gales it drifted about, and seemed so violent
and tormented, one might have supposed that the
furies were locked in mortal combat. The size and
increase of the dunes were so imperceptibly stealthy,
that it was scarcely noticed by those who lived in the
neighbourhood, but chiefly spoken of by people who
had been absent for some time. By and by, the old
coast-line began to break up, the sea made extensive
inroads, and there was a certain wasting of the fore-shore.
These high banks of sand afforded but a feeble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
barrier to the power of storms from the north—which
forced them further and further inshore; and still no
one minded, for a gale from the south usually blew
them back to their former position.</p>

<p>“One November night a fearful gale descended on
the coast. A sand-flood overwhelmed the fields, the
orchards, the gardens of Lanbryde—here was a deluge
that nothing could arrest. Ghostly clouds of white
sand, falling and whirling, above, below—in short,
everywhere. The torrent seemed to be a living force;
it poured over the mansion, and down its chimneys,
burst the doors and windows, and blocked the stairs.
The storm was as sudden as it was violent—it
approached with a howling, mighty wind, sheets and
clouds of a thin, white substance, tons—millions of
tons—of sand. The people of the house had barely
time to escape with their lives, before the doors and
stairs were choked. The young heir—who happened
to be home on leave—as he rushed out last, bethought
himself of the family sword—in short, of <i>me</i>! He
ran back, fought his way to the fireplace, while the
wind roared and the sand poured, wrenched me from
the wall, and sped forth. But in the doorway a blast
met him and knocked him prostrate—the cruel sand
fell on him, and choked him where he lay; he
struggled and fought—it was like being in the heart
of a quick-sand. After desperate efforts he gave up
the ghost, and so perished miserably—and there he
and I rested together for eighty long years. By midday,
after the gale, such was the result of shifting
dunes, that the very situation of the mansion was lost—and
the whole property, a vast expanse of sand, was
pointed out to newcomers as the grave of the house,
and estates, of Lanbryde.</p>

<p>“At last, after nearly a century had elapsed, a
furious western hurricane suddenly altered the figures
of many sandhills. Another violent storm arose, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
whirlwind equal to the first, and it raged all night
with a ruthless force. At sunrise, when the folk
began to stir, they rubbed their eyes, and wondered
if they were still asleep. Then they recalled the story
of Lanbryde. The mansion had reappeared—had
arisen, like a great, gaunt skeleton, from the mass of
sand in which it had been entombed, its rows of empty
windows, like eyeless sockets, dominating the scene.</p>

<p>“Naturally the news spread, and Lanbryde was
immediately visited, and, as far as possible, entered.
But the interior was still choked. The body of the
unfortunate heir was discovered—that is to say, his
bones—and I, who lay unscathed in my scabbard, was
carried away as prize by a searcher, and sold for a few
shillings to an armourer in Inverness, who sent me
south, where I fetched, as I deserved, a noble price.
Great efforts were made to recover furniture and
pictures that were known to be in Lanbryde, but
beyond a few silver spoons and the whorls of a distaff,
nothing could be reclaimed, for before any active steps
could be taken, another furious sand-drift struck the
coast, and the ancient mansion of Lanbryde disappeared
for ever.</p>

<p>“When the last owner’s daughter died in poverty
abroad, the family became extinct, and of their great
fame, and high place in the world, nothing now
remains but an old Italian sword.—Good-night!”</p>

THE KING’S SHILLING</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a melancholy afternoon early in November,
and a cold pitiless rain was streaming down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
library windows of Clonallon, the Irish residence of
Sir Domnick Donnelly, Bart., J.P., D.L.</p>

<p>At the other side of the wet panes, a pretty young
face gazed out upon the falling dusk and fallen leaves,
with an expression of hopeless boredom. Clonallon
was one of those solid box-shaped mansions that arose
in the country two centuries ago: spacious and comfortable,
with fine lofty rooms for the family, and
gloomy caverns for their retainers; it boasted a prolific
garden, a fine demesne, and a long and imposing
avenue. On the other hand, it was ten miles from a
station, did not possess a bathroom, and could only
count upon one post a day.</p>

<p>Sir Domnick and his wife (an elderly, childless
couple) were entirely satisfied with their abode—and
themselves; they maintained a certain amount of state
and formality, and processed about the neighbourhood
in an open carriage with two men-servants and a
pair of steppers. Recently a powerful motor had displaced
the landau, and the owners were so exuberantly
proud of their new possession that one would almost
suppose it was the very first car that had ever been
landed in Ireland!</p>

<p>The disconsolate girl in the window was also a
visitor from England; her mother, Mrs. de Lisle, a
smart evergreen widow, had certain “expectations”
from her relatives the Donnellys, and made a yearly
pilgrimage to Clonallon, in order, as she told herself,
“to keep the old people up to the mark.” She was
handsome and popular, with a pair of beguiling eyes,
and an insatiable appetite for society and excitement.
The large fortune left by her husband was strictly tied
up for the benefit of their daughter Vera. Vera, at
eighteen, looked younger than her age: so very soft
and simple, and was treated as a mere irresponsible
flapper by her parent; nevertheless Vera had inherited
a self-reliant enterprising character from the de Lisles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
(also a streak of daring and independence), but had
not as yet found an opportunity of exhibiting herself
in her true colours.</p>

<p>Life at Clonallon was desperately dull, and she
sorely missed the society of her girl friends; here,
everyone was so old—not merely Sir Domnick and
Lady Donnelly, but even the servants and dogs—whilst
the venerable green parrot was in his dotage.
The days seemed endless, from family prayers to
family prayers, the interim filled up with eating and
drinking, driving abroad to pay calls, or receiving
weird-looking visitors at home.</p>

<p>Once, oh great and happy occasion! they had all
motored to a neighbouring Meet; that was, indeed, a
delightful outing. On Sundays the family attended
a funny old church that smelt of mushrooms, and had
deep mysterious pews like rows of horse-boxes, as well
as a very large gallery, and a very small congregation.</p>

<p>Alas, there were still ten days to put in before
departure. Vera’s mother was thrifty in some ways,
and declared that short visits, long journeys, and
perpetual “tips” were too costly. Also, that after a
strenuous season, and Scotland, Clonallon served her
as an inexpensive “rest cure.”</p>

<p>Dusk was closing in over the pleasure-grounds, and
Vera, yawning till tears stood in her eyes, withdrew
from her post and sat down on a stiff-backed old sofa,
which stood between the tall windows.</p>

<p>Around a fine turf and wood fire the three elders
were assembled, Sir Domnick smoking a meerschaum
pipe, Mrs. de Lisle a Turkish cigarette—all three discussing
the neighbourhood, and Vera was completely
forgotten.</p>

<p>“And so your nearest neighbours are the
Meldons?” Mrs. de Lisle was saying.</p>

<p>“The nearest people we <i>visit</i>,” replied Lady Donnelly
with significant emphasis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“There is a big place in the trees, not more
than two miles away, on what you call ‘the back
road.’”</p>

<p>“Yes—Heganstown—the Hegans live there.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you know them?” persisted Mrs. de
Lisle.</p>

<p>After quite a marked pause, Lady Donnelly
replied: “Not now.”</p>

<p>“A feud—or a boycott?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly—although years ago there <i>was</i> a coolness
about some shooting. To tell you the truth, we
have dropped the Hegans—they are too impossible.”</p>

<p>“Short of murder or theft, it seems a pity to drop
such very near neighbours; it would have been so nice
to have them over to bridge!”</p>

<p>“Bridge!” repeated Sir Domnick, “I don’t suppose
they have ever heard of it! Hegan and I were
school-fellows, he was my fag too; he comes of a good
county family, went into the service, married, and
when his father departed, came back to Heganstown
with a nice little wife and a baby. Then Mrs. Hegan
died, and he seemed to go to pieces; took to gambling
on the Stock Exchange, betting, and whisky, and
married a blowzy fat creature, who was once his cook!
I believe she drinks, leads him the devil of a life, and
keeps the little money he has left. He is sunken in a
sort of stupor, and sits in his chair all day long; they
do say his brain is affected. I must confess I am
sorry for that young fellow Dermot.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but why are you sorry?” enquired Mrs. de
Lisle with an air of languid interest.</p>

<p>“The boy is out of his element; he went to Rugby,
and did uncommonly well; was going into the Army,
and had put in a couple of terms at Sandhurst, when
the money ran out, and he was obliged to come home.
He has been loafing about at Heganstown for the last
three years.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“Dear me, how perfectly dreadful!” ejaculated
the lady.</p>

<p>“At first he tried his hand on the farm, and pulling
the place together, but things were too far gone; his
father owed money all over the country, and the land
was let up to the hall door. A grazier has it, and his
cattle have played Old Harry with the grounds and
the plantations; there’s not a gate or a fence; the house
is falling to ruin. Mrs. Hegan has made away with
the good old furniture, and all the silver; last time I
was in Dublin I saw Hegan’s grandfather in a shop
ticketed ‘Four Pounds Ten’—of course I mean his
portrait.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t the young man try to do something?”</p>

<p>“It’s difficult to stir without money. I don’t suppose
the fellow has the price of a railway ticket, or a
second coat to his back. In our soft relaxing climate
it is so easy to let indolence grow on you—and to take
things as they come.”</p>

<p>“Dermot is a wonderful horseman,” supplemented
Lady Donnelly. “Men are only too glad to give him
mounts in the hunting season; he rides and breaks the
maddest-looking animals, and I believe he is a fine
shot too, but these accomplishments don’t put a penny
in his pocket. He has no companions of his own
class—<i>all</i> the young men are out in the world.”</p>

<p>“And the young women?” suggested Mrs. de
Lisle.</p>

<p>“Oh, none of the girls round here would look at
Dermot, except perhaps farmers’ daughters. I’ve
heard he has been seen about the lanes with Mitty
Flood—such a bold, shameless minx.”</p>

<p>“Well, if young Hegan marries Mitty, he is
<i>done</i>!” declared Sir Domnick. “I wish someone
would give the poor boy a hand, and help him out of
the quagmire; the longer he sticks at home, the deeper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
he sinks. I’m afraid he has no energy or push, and
not a penny to his name—it’s just a wasted life!”</p>

<p>“Does young Hegan come to church?” enquired
Mrs. de Lisle, “and does he sit in the second deep box
from the front, along with a red-faced female?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” rejoined Lady Donnelly.</p>

<p>“Then he really looks quite presentable, and I
believe I saw him at the Meet, riding a crazy chestnut.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” assented Sir Domnick, “and if
Dermot were to break his neck—under the circumstances,
it would be the best thing that could happen
to him!”</p>

<p>Vera, forgotten and in the background, had listened
to this conversation with the closest interest and
attention. She too recalled the good-looking young
man she had seen in church and at the Meet; she had
been struck by his masterly control of the frantic
chestnut, and the delightful ease with which he kept
his temper, and his seat.</p>

<p>The “automobile,” as Lady Donnelly grandiloquently
called it, held four comfortably, but no more,
and, at present, such was its novelty and fascination,
that its owners went out in it daily and in all weathers,
partly perhaps to exhibit their acquisition, and to
excite the envy of their friends.</p>

<p>Mrs. de Lisle enjoyed motoring; the soft moist air
was, she believed, good for her cure and complexion,
and therefore Vera, like the little pig of our childhood,
was left at home. However, as it happened, Vera
preferred rambling about the garden, the demesne, the
adjacent bog, and making friends with the country-folk.
Hobbs, her mother’s maid, was supposed to
be her escort, but Miss Hobbs, of London, disliked
country walks, and frequently excused herself on the
plea of a headache, or a corn; and Vera, with the
two red setters, was suffered to depart alone, Hobbs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
assuring herself that with the best wish in the world,
her young lady—a dear simple child—could not get
into any mischief.</p>

<p>But Hobbs was too sanguine. As she sat in the
housekeeper’s room with her feet on the fender, and
a strong cup of “Ann Lynch’s” best in her hand,
imparting society episodes to a gaping audience, her
charge was setting her pretty face in the direction of
an adventure.</p>

<p>The bog she was so fond of was not the traditional
dark tract, diversified by deep black holes and turf
clamps, but a wide expanse of short grass, studded
with furze bushes, and populated by goats, geese,
and rabbits. The air was delicious, the sensation of
unattended freedom intoxicating, the dogs were
happy, and so was Vera. She had a secret and sincere
love of Nature, and enjoyed her wild, unusual surroundings,
and the odd sights and sounds—such as
the flight of a V-shaped wedge of wild geese, the
sudden rise of a jack snipe; and felt completely independent,
and at home, as she walked briskly over the
springy turf. A line of dark woods beckoned her
thoughts to Heganstown, and the tragic fate of young
Hegan, caught in a quagmire of circumstance, and
compelled to lead a wasted life, with none to help him.
Surely Sir Domnick might hold out a hand; but he
wouldn’t—no, he was a selfish old pig—yes, he <i>was</i>;
he seized on all the new papers—even on the <i>Queen</i>;
he took more than his share of cream and oysters,
helped himself to the fowl’s liver, and most of the
motor rug—Vera had made it her business to watch
him! No, he would only exert himself to the extent
of his personal comforts, and young Hegan might
hang himself for all he cared!</p>

<p>Sir Domnick’s delinquencies, and the question of
assisting Dermot Hegan, occupied her mind to the
exclusion of everything else. She was wondering if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
she could forward him anonymously a five-pound
note, her godfather’s tip, when she suddenly became
aware of the rapid descent of a dense white mist, and
could hardly see six yards ahead. For a moment she
stood quite still, enveloped in a cloud of damp, impenetrable
mist; then she started to retrace her steps,
and after groping about for what seemed a long time,
realised that she was lost! In some inexplicable
manner she found herself upon an island apparently
surrounded on all sides by trenches of unfathomable
black water. This much she could discern. What
she could <i>not</i> see, was any means of departure.
Where was the wobbly stick that usually bridged such
chasms? The fog now turned from white to grey,
and she realised that her safest attitude was complete
inactivity, and sat down on a mound all alone—having
been basely abandoned by the two setters.</p>

<p>After a little reflection, she decided to call, to scream
for help; her voice was a fine robust soprano, and
carried fairly far.</p>

<p>Dermot Hegan, who had been shooting rabbits for
the larder, and was, so to speak, feeling his way home,
heard an unusual cry and halted. No, it was not a
curlew or a trapped rabbit, or even an owl. There
it was again, it came from a human throat, and said
“Help! Help! Help!” Dermot knew every inch of
the bog; the cry came from a part known as “the
Puzzle,” and it was not long before he had crossed
the ditch, and called out, “All right.” Then a shrill
treble voice from the gloom announced, “I’ve lost
my way; I don’t know where I am!”</p>

<p>The young man struck a match, held it aloft, and
discovered a girl, who had risen to her feet, and by
the faint illumination they gravely inspected one
another. He beheld a pretty face, and a pair of
startled dark eyes; and she was confronted by the
object of her meditations—no less a person than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
Dermot Hegan. Then the match, after the manner
of its kind, went out.</p>

<p>“You are the girl who is staying at Clonallon, are
you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, “I wandered about, and got
caught in the fog. Wherever I looked, I seemed to
be surrounded by huge ditches full of black water. I
was afraid to move—what <i>am</i> I to do?”</p>

<p>“Sit tight for the present: I hope you don’t mind
waiting?”</p>

<p>“What do you call waiting?”</p>

<p>“Well, say an hour. The moon will be up then,
and I will take you home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you. I think you must be Mr.
Hegan?”</p>

<p>“I wonder how you guessed? Yes, we live within
a quarter of a mile. I’ve known the bog since I was
a baby—but I dare not venture to steer you about in
the dark.”</p>

<p>“No, it would not be safe, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Lots of people have been lost on the bog from
time to time. They drop into these deep black holes,
and the peat holds and preserves them. I remember
long ago seeing the body of a girl, found after twenty
years. Her friends recognised her at once, though
she looked a bit leathery and dried up. Let me find
you a seat,” he added, striking another match.</p>

<p>Dermot Hegan had a nice well-bred voice, and by
the flickering match Vera noticed his well-kept but
rough hands, and frayed shirt-cuffs.</p>

<p>“How did you know I came from Clonallon?” she
asked, as they sat in outer darkness.</p>

<p>“I saw the dogs on the bog a while ago—we are
great friends.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know their owner?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” came the answer from a little distance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
where her companion had presumably found a
seat.</p>

<p>Suddenly Vera, the lion-hearted and impulsive,
made up her mind to take a bold step. With the
supreme assurance of youth, she resolved to seize this
priceless opportunity, and endeavour to open this
young man’s eyes to the dangers of his situation.</p>

<p>“Is it not surprising,” she began, “that we two
utter strangers should find ourselves imprisoned here
in the dark?”</p>

<p>“Surprising things are said to happen on this
particular spot,” was his unexpected answer. “They
say it’s an old fairy rath, engulfed by the bog, and
sometimes people can’t find their way off it. There <i>is</i>
a way, of course—but it’s a bit of a puzzle. I expect
your friends will be wondering what has become of
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, they went for a long motor drive, and
won’t be home before seven.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s a little after six, so we are stuck here
for the best part of an hour. What shall we do—tell
stories, or sing?—do you sing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’d much rather talk.” As Vera could
not see her listener, she felt surprisingly brave, and
went on, “I have something to say to you.”</p>

<p>“To say to <i>me</i>?” His voice expressed bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Yes, Chance or the fairies have given me this
opening, and I must speak—even if you are mortally
offended, and feel inclined to drown me in a bog-hole.”</p>

<p>“I won’t be offended—so go ahead; line clear.”</p>

<p>“The other evening I heard Sir Domnick talking
about—er—er—Heganstown; he said he and your
father were school-fellows.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Did he happen to tell you how we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
had come down in the world, and were beggars?”
The tone of the question was hard and bitter.</p>

<p>“He did, and he said he was so sorry for you, who
were just wasting your life.”</p>

<p>“That’s true—it’s a rotten life, I know. Did he
suggest any alternative?”</p>

<p>“No; he said he was afraid you had acquired the
loafing habit—and——”</p>

<p>“And what else?”</p>

<p>“And had an attraction in the neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he meant a girl?”</p>

<p>“He did; her name is Mitty Flood. Lady Donnelly
said she was a bold, pushing minx—nothing to
what <i>I</i> am myself, at this moment—and I would never
dare to say what I have said, only that you cannot
<i>see</i> me now, and after this evening will never meet
me again.”</p>

<p>“No? I would not be so sure of that! So you
are speaking out for what is called my good? Nameless
young lady in the dark, it is most awfully kind
of you, but I’m past help. How can I go out into
the world without a sixpence? without decent clothes,
without a single friend? I have no interest, and not
much brains; all my pals at school and at Sandhurst
are doing their job, and I’ve dropped them; never
answered their letters, for I’d be ashamed to let them
know I was just slacking about at home, shooting
rabbits, breaking in young horses—and eating my
heart out—a prisoner to poverty. There now! the
dark has opened my lips <i>too</i>—I’ve never said as much
to a living soul.”</p>

<p>“But you can easily free yourself,” said the girl
with easy confidence. “You have been well
educated; you are young, and strong.”</p>

<p>“Young and strong—yes—but I’ve no money to
make even a humble start. I had thought of going
to Dublin, and getting taken on as a tram conductor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
at, say, eighteen shillings a week, but it would barely
keep me, and I’m worth that at home, shooting wild
duck and rabbits, an outlying Donnelly pheasant, or
finding plovers’ eggs, and digging potatoes. As for
Mitty Flood—what beastly gossip! I hardly know
her, and I don’t want to know her. One day her
bicycle broke down, and she asked me to help her,
and when she meets me she stops to talk—that’s
all.”</p>

<p>(Vera mentally decided that the bicycle was an
excuse, that the meetings were <i>not</i> accidental, and
that Mitty was a minx!)</p>

<p>“An attraction here,” he continued; “why, the
very idea makes me laugh. If you only knew what
my life <i>is</i>, you’d laugh, too.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I would,” she protested. “I know
a little about you; you know nothing of me, which is
not fair, so I shall tell you who I am. My name is
Vera de Lisle; my mother is related to the Donnellys;
she is a widow, and I am her only child. We live in
Charles Street, Mayfair, and are well off. I am
eighteen—I left school last Easter. I have been presented,
and to one or two balls—only mother thinks
I am too young to racket about—and am to come out
in earnest next season.”</p>

<p>“Yes—and what else?”</p>

<p>“I like tennis and dancing, and other girls who are
jolly—and dogs—no, <i>not</i> the setters. I am furious
with them. Also I enjoy reading, and being alone
sometimes, and having a real good long think.”</p>

<p>“As we are being so extraordinarily outspoken,
may I ask, do you think of anyone in particular—you
know what I mean?”</p>

<p>“No one in the way you suggest—I am not a bit
susceptible.”</p>

<p>“That is to say, not <i>yet</i>, but being young, pretty,
and rich, a great match will come along some day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“If it does I shall blow it out!” she rejoined with
a happy laugh.</p>

<p>“Are you not bored to death at Clonallon?”</p>

<p>“Not always. I like the old gardens, and the park,
and I love this bog—somehow I find it curiously
alluring; a sort of wild, out of the world, dreamy
place.”</p>

<p>After a short silence, he said:</p>

<p>“It is awfully good of you to take an interest in
me.”</p>

<p>“I do more,” she interrupted. “I am going to
offer you an idea—an idea which has just flashed into
my mind: why not enlist?”</p>

<p>“Enlist?” he repeated; “take the King’s Shilling?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if I were in your place I’d do it like a shot.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t know <i>much</i> about the life of a
private, do you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if you are going to be fastidious, I say
no more; but there are lots of gentlemen in the ranks,
and many rankers become officers on their own merits.
One of my girl friends has a brother—why”—and
she paused—“there’s the moon!”</p>

<p>Unobserved by the pair, a gradual lightening of the
clouds had been steadily taking place; now these had
suddenly parted, and the moon with her lidless eye
stared down upon the young people—who glanced at
one another interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Well, you have given me a lead,” said Hegan,
springing to his feet, “and, by Jove, I’ll take it, and
the King’s Shilling, to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Hegan, perhaps I may be wrong,” she
protested, startled by her success. “Do not be led
by me—after all, I’m little more than a school-girl. I
have no real experience. Don’t do anything in a
hurry.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I see your courage cannot stand the moonlight—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
your misgivings come too late. I shall
sell my old ticker, also my old gun, and start off and
offer myself at a cavalry depôt. I’ll apply for a regiment
in India.”</p>

<p>“I am really frightened at my presumption,” she
murmured.</p>

<p>“You need not be, I just wanted the call to start
me; no one has ever spoken the word ‘off’ till now.
This for young people is a sleepy enervating part of
the world; the big trees and the water suck up vitality,
and make one disinclined to rise, and be doing, and
to shake off sloth. With a fairly active body I have
an indolent and fatalistic mind. Miss de Lisle, I am
your debtor for life.”</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen!” she protested.</p>

<p>“Well”—now consulting an old silver turnip—“it
is nearly seven, and I must take you home; but first
of all you will have to come with me to Heganstown.
I guarantee you’ll see no one, and I’ll get you back
soon after seven, drive you over in the dogcart,
deposit you at the back gate, and leave you to manage
the rest.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I’ll do whatever you wish,” she replied.</p>

<p>“All right, then come on”—the usual British invitation—and
Vera followed her new acquaintance off
the rath, and in a short time found herself in an overgrown
neglected avenue, leading to a great forlorn
old house, that looked forbiddingly grim in the moonlight.
Hegan turned the handle of the hall door, and
ushered his companion into an immense vaulted hall,
entirely bare of furniture.</p>

<p>“Just wait in here,” and he opened the door into
what had once been a library—a large apartment
flooded by moonlight, which revealed rows of bare
bookshelves and square marks on the walls, where
pictures had been, and were not. The room was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
empty, and apparently the house was in the same condition;
there was not a sound to be heard.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a shuffling of feet, and a loud
voice in the hall calling for “Rabbits—rabbits—where’s
them rabbits?”</p>

<p>Then the door burst open, and an unwieldy female
figure appeared, staggering on the threshold.</p>

<p>“Where’s that lazy, good-for-nothing blaggard?”
she demanded.</p>

<p>Catching sight of Vera, she paused, stared, and
then, with one ear-splitting yell, turned and fled. A
few minutes after this astonishing visitor had disappeared,
Hegan entered, whip in hand.</p>

<p>“Sorry to have kept you—I had to borrow a horse.
The ‘Yoke,’ as they call it, awaits you.”</p>

<p>There at the steps stood a high dogcart, with a
shaggy cart-horse in the shafts, and in another
moment Vera was bumping down the ill-kept drive.
Either Hegan was a capital whip, or the cart-horse
had a bit of pedigree, for once on the road they bowled
along at a spanking pace.</p>

<p>“Who was the woman who came into the room?”
inquired Vera.</p>

<p>“My step-mother; she took you for the family
ghost—I believe she is screeching still.”</p>

<p>Two miles were soon devoured by the cart mare’s
hairy legs, and as Hegan drew up at the back gate of
Clonallon, he said:</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Miss de Lisle. We met an hour ago,
and I feel as if we had known one another for years.
You are my starter, and I hope I may do you credit.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you must think me frightfully
audacious and interfering. My mother says I am
impulsive and headlong, and do rash, unexpected
things. Oh, I hope I have not been extra foolish and
meddlesome. Do let me hear how you get on. Will
you write?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“If I may,” he answered, secretly amazed.</p>

<p>“2,000, Charles Street, Mayfair. Good-bye and
good luck.” She held out her hand, then darted up
the avenue, and was lost to sight.</p>

<p>Luckily the motor relayed by the fog had not yet
returned, and Vera had time to don an evening frock,
and sink into a chair, novel in hand, before the party
arrived full of explanations and apologies.</p>

<p>Three days later Miss de Lisle received a note
written on cheap paper, in a fine bold style:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have joined the Blueskin Lancers, and as soon as
I am through riding school go out to India with a draft.
I enclose the identical King’s Shilling for your acceptance,
and remain,</p>

<p class="right">“Yours faithfully, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br>

“<span class="smcap">D. Hegan</span>, Trooper.”</p>
</div>

<p>Vera contrived to have a hole bored in the shilling,
and wore it with other charms on her favourite bangle.
The enterprise of Dermot Hegan was disclosed by Sir
Domnick, always well posted in local news—<i>no</i> item
too insignificant.</p>

<p>“So I hear that young Hegan has enlisted,” he
announced, “and is going out to India. Best thing
he can do—wonder he never thought of it before. Just
the class of chap to make his way in the service.”</p>

<p>Dermot Hegan remained in India for four years,
and made his way. His steady character, good education,
and notable horsemanship helped him to a commission.
He and Vera had corresponded at long
and fitful intervals. When he was promoted sergeant
she sent him her photograph; when he was gazetted
to a regiment at home she invited him, if in London,
to come and see her.</p>

<p>Vera was now twenty-two, her own mistress, and,
as her mother bewailed, “absolutely hopeless” with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
respect to a suitable marriage. Not one of her many
admirers seemed to make any serious impression, and
yet she was a bright, amusing, popular girl with many
men friends. More than one experienced chaperone
had whispered to Mrs. de Lisle that “there must be
<i>someone</i> in the background!” but this suggestion she
denied with passionate emphasis, saying:</p>

<p>“Vera has no heart, in one sense. I have never
seen her really interested, and she has not been out
of my sight since she left her nurse’s arms.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hegan, 50th Hussars, duly made his appearance
in Charles Street, a remarkably well-set-up,
smart-looking young officer, and Mrs. de Lisle—believing
him to be one of Vera’s partners—accorded
him a gracious welcome. Presently he and her
daughter retired into the back drawing-room, ostensibly
to look at some photographs, and here, in a few
hurried sentences, he informed Vera that his father
and step-mother were both dead, that a distant relative
had left him a legacy, which had enabled him to pay
off some debts, and to repair the roof of Heganstown.</p>

<p>“I have an honest steward,” he added, “and I get
enough money out of the place to pay my tailor, and
mess bill. I’ve done all right so far—and been uncommonly
lucky, thanks to <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“No thanks to me—thanks to this,” and she exhibited
her bangle, and the dangling King’s shilling.</p>

<p>“I say, you can’t think the help your letters were,”
he went on. “Somehow they seemed to keep me
afloat; is it not funny that, until now, we have never
seen one another by daylight?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she assented; “but all the same,” and she
coloured deeply, “it is not considered good manners
to <i>stare</i>!”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, but my stare is excusable! I
seem to know you better than anyone—and yet until
now I’d only seen you by moonlight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“That excuse is moonshine,” she rejoined with a
laugh.</p>

<p>Presently her mother came forward, and cruelly
interrupted a confidential talk, saying:</p>

<p>“Darling, Lord Hubert has come and brought
something he wants to show you.” (Lord Hubert
was reported to be “making the running” with the
little de Lisle girl.)</p>

<p>Mr. Hegan was duly bidden to dinner, also to a
dance given by Mrs. de Lisle, and gratefully accepted
both invitations; but he soon realised the awful chasm
that lay between him and an heiress. How dared <i>he</i>
compete with the son of a Duke? Hopeless and heartbroken
he withdrew into obscurity—that is to say, his
quarters in Canterbury Barracks. When war had
been declared, and his regiment was under orders,
Hegan snatched an hour’s leave to say good-bye to
Vera—no harm in that!—and he had the good fortune
to find her at home, and alone.</p>

<p>“So we are at war!” she exclaimed; “it seems
incredible, a hideous nightmare, and I’ve led you into
what may be battle, and sudden death.”</p>

<p>“I’m thankful that you did—anyway, of course
I’d have joined now, but I’m a more useful unit as
it is. Wish me luck.”</p>

<p>“I wish you good luck, honours, and a safe
return.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that that matters. You see, I’ve no
belongings, and no one to care, if I ever come back.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> care,” she announced unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“Do you really mean that, Miss de Lisle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. Oh, here’s mother!” as that lady
hurried into the room full of news, and excitement.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After Mons, and the battle of the Aisne, Mr.
Hegan, who was badly wounded, was promoted, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
got his troop. He made light of his injuries, and
speedily returned to the Front. Later on, all through
the dreary winter in the muddy trenches, he was
cheered by Vera’s letters, and through all the rack and
strain of war his unfailing spirits and infectious laugh
proved an inestimable boon to his comrades. In
action on the Somme he was in the thick of the hottest
charges, distinguished himself amazingly; saved the
life of a brother officer—but lost his own left arm.</p>

<p>As a certain Red Cross train reached Victoria
Station, Miss de Lisle, a Red Cross nurse, was waiting
to receive her friend. He had contrived to keep his
injury a secret, and when she exclaimed at his empty
sleeve, he said:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Vera. I’ve brought you something
in exchange—a bit of ribbon.”</p>

<p>“A bit of ribbon?” she repeated in a doubtful tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am proud to tell you that I have been
recommended for the Victoria Cross—<i>that</i> is the
interest on the King’s Shilling!”</p>

A DARK HORSE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Major Mahon died, he left his affairs in such
desperate confusion that even a hardened Irish agent,
well accustomed to family disasters and unexpected
disclosures, was dumbfounded. Kil-Mahon property
was mortgaged beyond recovery; the gay, hospitable,
hard-riding Major had lived extravagantly and spent
precisely as if his capital were a yearly income, and
his income pocket-money—and after his funeral came
the deluge.</p>

<p>The deluge, indeed! His pretty daughter, who
was just twenty-one, found herself homeless, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
ancestral mansion now belonged to creditors; there
was an auction, and the family goods and heirlooms
were scattered to the four winds. Her brother Tom,
who was serving in India—the supposed heir to a
fine fortune, and living up to the belief—was compelled
to leave his regiment, and promptly return to
Ireland.</p>

<p>Tom Mahon was a manly, good-looking young
fellow of six and twenty, with typical dark blue eyes
and black hair, a capital polo player, a popular officer,
but never likely to ignite either the Thames or the
Liffey.</p>

<p>Fortunately Tom was practical; he sold off his guns
and ponies, paid his debts, and, when he arrived,
exerted himself to the utmost to pull things together.
He decided not to emigrate to Canada and take
Helena with him, as their relatives so eagerly
suggested (relatives who lived in England, and were
aghast at the downfall of the Mahons of Kil-Mahon),
but to gather what he could from the wreck, and make
a home for himself and sister. They could manage
on little, and were not proud. There remained an
insignificant scrap of the estate (possibly overlooked)
and here at least was a roof for the outcasts, for the
English Mahons had with one accord washed their
hands of this crazy, reckless couple. Kil-Mahon was
sold to an Irish-American, who had returned to his
native country with an immense hoard of dollars; but
Clontra, situated on the wrong side of the same
county, a good-sized ivy-covered house with its rows
of small windows facing north (that ancient and surprising
fashion), still belonged to the Mahons. A
flower garden, a small lawn, and a thick hedge
separated it from a not much frequented highroad;
in a field across the way were the remains of Castle
O’Mahon—cradle of the race. At the back of the
house was a matted, tangled garden, a large range of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
tumble-down outhouses, a few fields of fairly good
pasture beyond, and, encircling house and fields, about
four hundred acres of worthless bog—not the usual
black bog, full of water-holes, and turf stacks, but
“short grass” bog, dotted with clumps of furze
bushes, and rushes, affording a certain amount of
grazing for geese and donkeys.</p>

<p>Tom and Helena had lived two years at Clontra
and effected wonders; the venerable garden was
restored and prosperous; the outhouses had been
patched up, the dull rooms gaily papered and made
to look homely with a few odds and ends of wreckage
and Helena’s clever fingers. In the yard were milch
cows, and poultry; in the house several dogs and
three family servants: old Pat, a handy man and
groom, young Pat, gardener and herd, and Kate, the
maid-of-all work—a dark little woman of forty-five,
born and brought up on Kil-Mahon, a truly devout
adherent of the Mahon race, a hard worker and
“vocheen,” her particular and unintentionally
blasphemous declaration on all occasions being,
“Sure, ’tis all the will of God!”</p>

<p>The cows, poultry, and garden kept the place—so
to speak—going, but the life was an extraordinary
change to the two Mahons. Handsome Tom, as sub.
in a smart regiment, with his polo ponies, dogcart—and
perhaps a certain amount of side—was now working
hard to earn his bread. Helena, the admired,
petted, slightly arbitrary daughter of a house whose
popular, genial head was an important factor in
Society, was his efficient and industrious partner.</p>

<p>Here the brother and sister were moored in a sort
of social backwater, and more or less forgotten. It
is so easy to drop out of the swim! Tom, in rough
tweeds and gaiters, rose at dawn to buy and sell
cattle and calves at neighbouring fairs, or superintend
the gardening and the small farm—and now and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
then, in the season, was offered a day’s hunting or
shooting by old friends.</p>

<p>Helena managed the dairy and poultry, sold her
butter and eggs and vegetables; she had a good
market at Newbridge and the Curragh. Between the
young cattle, and these items, the pair paid their
way, and contrived to make both ends meet.
Helena’s equipage was a donkey-cart or else shanks’
mare, Tom rode a rickety bicycle, and they were invariably
spoken of as “those poor young Mahons.”
All the same, they were by no means unhappy, and
enjoyed excellent health and spirits, were fully
employed from breakfast to supper, and had no time
to meditate on their fallen fortunes. They were
young and independent, they both loved animals,
flowers, sport, and their own country.</p>

<p>“There is the baker’s cart, Tom!” said his sister,
rising from her exertions in weeding a flower-bed in
the front garden. “Isn’t it wicked to drive that poor
horse!—he is dead lame in his near-fore.”</p>

<p>“Lame, I should think so!” assented Tom, as he
looked over the hedge at a heavy red bread-cart, in
whose shafts a powerful black horse hobbled painfully.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” he shouted. The man pulled up,
though the Mahons were not customers. Kate was
<i>their</i> baker.</p>

<p>“I say, that horse of yours is very lame! Has he
a stone in his hoof?” and he went to the gate.</p>

<p>“No, yer honour,” replied the driver, “it’s his
corns, and they do be cruel. We’ve had him to the
farrier—and he can do nothing whatever.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity,” said Tom, casting his eye over the
animal, an upstanding, raking black who seemed in
a sweat, not so much from overwork as pain; his
condition was poor, and his great wild eyes wore a
look of intense suffering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“Aye, he’s a powerful fine horse,” continued his
driver, “and a bread-cart comes strange to him, I’m
thinking; you would not believe, your honour, how
cruel heavy these carts does be—and it’s not alone the
road, but the long gentry’s avenues of maybe a mile
extra we does have to travel. I declare, though,
this poor animal is willing, and has a grand sperrit—but
what with the corns and the cart, his heart is
about bruk!”</p>

<p>“He looks a well-bred one too,” remarked Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s that, or he’d be dead a couple of months
back. I believe Broughal got him at an auction,
cheap, along with a bad name. Well, well, he’s
nearly done, and I must be going. Good-day to yer
honour,” and he lumbered on.</p>

<p>Helena had been an attentive listener to this conversation
and her heart was melted with pity. She
was keenly sensitive to the sorrows of dumb animals,
and the lame horse, his long rounds, distressed and
haunted her thoughts. Unconsciously she came to
watch for his passing in the fierce heat of a summer
afternoon and to listen despite herself for the distant
approaching cart and the accompanying “Clip, clop,
<i>stop</i>, clip, clop, <i>stop</i>” of the poor brute that so painfully
dragged it. The baker was not very punctual;
sometimes it was twelve, sometimes two o’clock when
he went by, but Helena was invariably there to see,
and to offer the black a bit of bread or a lump of
sugar. She was so sorry for him and he seemed so
grateful for her sympathy. In short, the lame black
horse had become an obsession and settled upon Miss
Mahon’s nerves: at night she sometimes had a little
private cry when she thought of him, and his
existence of hopeless misery.</p>

<p>At last he was released, and she was relieved. For
three days the baker’s cart went by drawn by a mealy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
bay; evidently the big black had been granted a well-earned
rest.</p>

<p>One morning quite early Miss Mahon happened to
be in the garden cutting roses, and saw—yes—the
black horse passing! On this occasion he was
ridden; a man had thrown a sack over his back and
sat astride in an easy attitude, pipe in mouth. Alas!
the black was lamer than ever! Helena waved to the
rider to halt, which he did—Irish-like, only too glad
of an interruption to his errand.</p>

<p>“Is that the horse that used to draw the bread-cart?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Faix it is so, me lady.”</p>

<p>“And where is he going?”</p>

<p>“Only to Rathcourt, and ’tis his last journey.”</p>

<p>She stared interrogatively.</p>

<p>“The Kennels, you know. Mr. Broughal has
sold him for twenty-five shillings, and glad to be shut
of him too! He’s been dead lame the whole summer,
and having all the bread rounds hours behind-hand,
and giving great complaints, and torment; so here he
goes!” and he gave the rope reins a slap.</p>

<p>“No, no, just wait,” she said, opening the gate
and coming into the road. She laid her hands upon
the animal’s neck. He turned; evidently he was once
accustomed to being caressed by a lady. His large
intelligent eyes spoke volumes of suffering and
misery.</p>

<p>“Do you think Mr. Broughal would let <i>me</i> have
him for thirty shillings?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Sure, and why not? Isn’t five shillings five
shillings?” was the confident reply.</p>

<p>“Then get off, and lead him in, if you please.”</p>

<p>“What’s all this, Helena?” asked her brother,
who now appeared with the dogs at his heels.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, it’s the bread-cart horse! I’ve just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
<i>bought</i> him,” she answered, looking very pale and
determined.</p>

<p>“What?” he exclaimed, gazing at her open-mouthed.</p>

<p>“Listen,” drawing him to one side. “He was
sold for twenty-five shillings, and going to the
Kennels.”</p>

<p>“His betters have gone the same road, poor old
boy. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“I’m giving thirty shillings. I have it in my own
private purse—egg money, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and he laughed, and nodded.</p>

<p>“And you, Tom—won’t you give him a run on
the bog till winter—let him have his shoes off, and
his <i>chance</i>? If he is still a cripple you can shoot him—if
not you shall ride him; you said yourself he was
the plan of a well-bred hunter.”</p>

<p>“All right, Sis, but if we are to buy and keep every
old garron that passes the gate, we shall be in the
poor-house sooner than ever.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, you love horses, and we’ve nothing
but old Dolly and Sarah for the carts; the baker is a
gentleman, and if he recovers, who knows but you
may ride him to hounds!”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! I think I see myself on that bag of
bones!”</p>

<p>“You may—and now I’ll fetch you the money.
Just wait; do <i>you</i> buy; give the man the thirty
shillings, and a bottle of porter, and get a receipt.”</p>

<p>And she flew upstairs and returned with a dirty
one-pound note, and ten shillings in silver. The
bargain was concluded and duly “wet” by a pint
of stout, and the man, before he walked off with the
sack on his back, said:</p>

<p>“Well—good luck to yer honour! If that black
horse ever comes round—mind, I’m not saying he
<i>will</i>—ye will find ye have got grand value for yer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
thirty shillings; for me own part, I’m glad I’m not
taking the poor baste to the hounds; and faix, even
if I did, there’s little on him—he just wore himself
out between being so anxious to do his best, and them
corns that were killing him.”</p>

<p>There was a popular forge at a cross-road half a
mile away from Clontra, and there Tom himself led
the new purchase to have his shoes removed that same
afternoon.</p>

<p>Old Jimmy was a good judge of horses, a gossip
and a well-known character.</p>

<p>“’Tis Broughal’s ould bread horse!” he exclaimed.
“May I never—well, ’tis a charity to take
the shoes off. Faix, I know what it is—I’ve bad
corns meself, and I’ll soon give him aise. A great
horse!” he said, standing back and surveying the
tall, emaciated animal—whose ribs were easily
counted. “He’s terrible well-bred too—Broughal
got him at a sale for nothing at all—but as sure as
I’m a sinner, he’s a Harkaway. Will ye look at the
head on him? What are ye going to do with him—is
it cart, or plough?”</p>

<p>“He’s to have a run on the bog,” replied Tom.
“He belongs to Miss Helena.”</p>

<p>“The Lord love her! she’s a saint! It nearly bruk
me own heart to see the poor fellow limping by under
two ton of a load, all this frightful hot summer.
Miss Helena will get it back—and with grand
interest.”</p>

<p>But this was not Kate’s (the cook’s) opinion, who
when she heard that her mistress had bought a great
spectre of a lame black horse, was very sorrowful.</p>

<p>“Thirty shillings, Miss Helena! The money for
your new hat for the garden-party. You can’t go in
the ould wan, and goodness knows what chances
you’ve thrown behind ye! Well,” piously raising
her hands and eyes, “sure, ’tis all the will of God.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>Tom and Helena had a busy, prosperous season.
Helena’s market at Newbridge and the Camp was
such that she was obliged to send three carts a week
with butter, eggs, vegetables, and flowers, and buy
another donkey. Tom, too, had his hands full; the
tide had turned, and they were both so much occupied
with important matters that they entirely forgot the
black horse who was enjoying a run on the bog.
Tom had an old friend stationed at Newbridge, an
officer in the Lancers, who made his way over to call,
and though the distance was twelve Irish miles, for a
reason best known to himself he returned repeatedly.
One Sunday after lunch the Mahons and their guest
walked down to the bog; it was the end of September,
and there was an idea that it might hold a few packs
of grouse. As they advanced over the springy turf,
along a beaten track, then over a wobbly stick across
a bog-hole, they descried, far away among the gorse
and geese, a remarkably fine upstanding black horse.
His attitude implied dignified expectancy, as he
gazed in their direction.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” cried Tom. “Why, Helena—look at
your purchase. I declare I scarcely know him!”</p>

<p>“All the better for his two months’ holiday—oh, I
say!” as the black suddenly wheeled about, took a
wide ditch in an easy stride, and galloped off with
streaming tail.</p>

<p>“Not much the matter with that fellow—and can’t
he jump!” exclaimed Captain Forde. “Your
property, Miss Mahon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and, do you know, I’d almost forgotten
him.”</p>

<p>“I advise you not to do that—he looks like a
chaser.”</p>

<p>“A chaser!” she repeated with a laugh. “I
bought him out of a bread-cart ten weeks ago. I
pitied him so much because he had so many miles to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
go every day, and he was so terribly lame. They
were sending him to the Kennels. His price was
thirty shillings—and Tom gave him a run here.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious! You are not serious? This is
one of your Irish jokes.”</p>

<p>“I say, Helena, we’ll have him up and look at
him,” said Tom; “Tony shall vet. him; he is great
on horses.”</p>

<p>“All right—we will send down old Pat with a
head-stall, and interview the Baker after tea.”</p>

<p>The Baker, seduced by the sight of a bucket, looking
wild, rough, and happy, was duly brought up,
examined, trotted to and fro—and passed.</p>

<p>“Have him in, and ride him about quietly, Tom,”
urged his adviser, “you are such a nice light weight.
He looks a hunter all over—and something more;
but time will tell.”</p>

<p>“Then you think he was a bargain?” said Helena.</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it,” he answered with emphasis,
“sound—up to weight—rising seven—and uncommonly
good-looking. Look here, Miss Mahon, if
you are inclined to sell I’ll give you sixty pounds
for him just as he stands—without his shoes.”</p>

<p>“Sixty pounds! No, no, I don’t want to sell him
or rob you,” she answered, “and he will be something
for Tom to ride—he hates a bike—and the black
looks such a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“He is, I’ll bet. I suppose you don’t know his
pedigree?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid we can’t trace that beyond the
bread-cart.”</p>

<p>“I shall always take an interest in your horse, Miss
Mahon, and Tom, my advice to you is, bring him in
at once.”</p>

<p>“Come over and see how he turns out.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure the poor Baker will be sorry we happened
to notice him to-day,” said Helena, “and took him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
away from the nice short grass and bog—and his two
dear donkeys.”</p>

<p>Within a week the Baker was carefully shod by old
Jimmy, and put into regular work. He proved a
delightful mount, and seemed thoroughly to appreciate
being ridden, especially on the turf, and
popped over fences with an agility that spoke of
practice.</p>

<p>“I declare, Sis,” said her brother after a rousing
gallop round the fields, “you are a witch. This
horse is a treasure and worth a pot of money. I shall
school him a little, hunt him, and if he turns out well,
will enter him for some of the big races at Leopardstown
and Punchestown—and we will keep him <i>dark</i>—back
him—and make our fortunes.”</p>

<p>Jimmy Horrigan, the blacksmith, was also a sincere
admirer of the Baker, and on Sundays would come
up to the stable, lean on the half-door, pipe in mouth,
and talk him over with old Pat.</p>

<p>“He is a great plan of a horse, and I was watching
him being schooled, and begor! I never ask to see a
better lepper, bold and quick and safe as the Rock of
Cashel. Faix, he would make a big bid for the Grand
National.” Seeing young Mahon approach, he said,
“Come here to me now, Mr. Tom, till I tell ye something.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Ye have a fortune here in the black horse.”</p>

<p>“I know that.”</p>

<p>“But ye don’t know everything,” waxing confidential
and speaking behind his hand. “Lately it
has been put in me way to open yer eyes. Ye mind
Mr. Grady who died a couple of years back and the
grand auction of his horses—pedigree mares, foals,
and chasers? This horse here,” nodding over the
half-door, “was in that sale—and sold by mistake.”</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“It was a big business—two days—and the last
day, when it was getting darkish, a groom who had
taken drink mixed two lots, Sarsfield and his half-brother—the
dog-cart horse. Some poor divil bought
him for Sarsfield, who had a great character though
untried, and paid a long price and got properly stuck,
and afterwards made a terrible rebellion with the
auctioneer, who faced it down that it <i>was</i> Sarsfield he
had. Howsomever the real Sarsfield was gone, and
could never be traced, though he had a funny little
mark on his hoof. I’ve made out he was sold to a
Dublin jarvey for twenty-five sovereigns, being real
smart looking, but he made matches of the car, and
put the fear of death on the driver, who passed him
to a canal boatman, and bedad! he kicked <i>him</i> into
the water. I can’t rightly tell you where he went to
next, but, after a long while, Broughal the baker
bought him for a matter of five pound; he was in low
condition, and, says he, he won’t rise his heels in the
bread-cart, and the long and the short of it is that I’m
thinking you have the lost Sarsfield snug here in a
loose box. The other day I noticed the print on him,
and bedad, ye’ve a rare bargain for yer thirty shilling.
The Grady stable had terrible high hopes of him,
though he was delicate and kep’ back; and all you and
Miss Helena has got to do now is to sit tight, and go
in and win.”</p>

<p>The Baker was hunted all the winter, and it would
be hard to say which—he or Tom Mahon—enjoyed
the season the more heartily. He was entered for
several events, was put into hard training and galloped
upon that most elastic of turf, the Curragh of Kildare.
Subsequently he won, as a complete outsider, a big
race at Punchestown, others at Lincoln and Liverpool,
and within twelve months, in bets and stakes,
ten thousand pounds for his grateful owners: in short,
he restored their fortunes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>The Baker is now a pensioner, the Mahons having
refused to part with him, even for a tempting price.
He spends his summer on the bog in company with
a donkey, his old companion; in winter, he occasionally
appears at Meets, and goes admirably in a
short run—just to show the younger performers how
the thing should be done! On such occasions he is
pointed out to strangers as that celebrated chaser, the
Baker; but the story of the baker’s cart, and his
reputed price of thirty shillings, is looked upon as an
amusing fiction.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
